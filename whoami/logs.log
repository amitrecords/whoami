[06/05 11:05] <Amit_away> Oh, the topic is the same here too!??
[06/05 11:05] <02charlie> wlecome to the rock amit
[06/05 11:05] <Amit_away> Thank you!
[06/05 11:05] <Amit_away> feels like i graduated from costrain to the rock!
[06/05 11:05] <dsk_hbe> I thought that was interesting... time setting and everything, though changed to chanserv
[06/05 11:06] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/05 11:06] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/05 11:06] <dsk_hbe> with all the pomp and circumstance due ;-)
[06/05 11:07] <02charlie> you were gone from costrain before i could say "something important" there debbie :D
[06/05 11:07] <dsk_hbe> my instincts were good then ;-)
[06/05 11:08] <02charlie> lol
[06/05 11:08] <02charlie> im feeling partularly irreverent today
[06/05 11:10] <JimE_zOS> and I'm feeling old and tired.  Yard work yesterday and my fitbit claims I walked 15 miles. 
[06/05 11:10] <dsk_hbe> oh my!!
[06/05 11:10] <JimE_zOS> I got my "30K Steps" badge. 
[06/05 11:11] <dsk_hbe> I bet you are so sore!!
[06/05 11:11] <JimE_zOS> I'm giving serious thought to taking PTO every non-oncall week of the summer. 
[06/05 11:11] <triveni> now dis i can understand.. wow!! congratulations!!
[06/05 11:12] <JimE_zOS> help spread out the yard work a little. 
[06/05 11:12] <dsk_hbe> it might be the first time you ever don't lose PTO time to non-use
[06/05 11:15] <06Amit_zOS> debbie must be relieved to get rid of one extra box!
[06/05 11:15] <06Amit_zOS> :P
[06/05 11:16] <dsk_hbe> I am... just way too many windows to watch/listen to ;-)
[06/05 11:16] <02charlie> i'm planning on taking a comp day friday
[06/05 11:16] <02charlie> unless you folks have a problem with that
[06/05 11:16] <JimE_zOS> no problem here. 
[06/05 11:17] <02charlie> and i dont recall if i mentioned i wanted to take the last week of june to go to DC
[06/05 11:17] <JimE_zOS> and I won't start my "Friday off" thing until later. 
[06/05 11:17] <dsk_hbe> no problem here, Charlie
[06/05 11:17] <JimE_zOS> ie, I plan to be here this Friday 
[06/05 11:17] <dsk_hbe> I think you did Charlie, perhaps not the planned location
[06/05 11:17] <06Amit_zOS> oh.. you guys have planned out the whole year haven't you!?
[06/05 11:18] <JimE_zOS> not exactly. 
[06/05 11:18] <JimE_zOS> at least I haven't. 
[06/05 11:18] <dsk_hbe> oh no... I still have about 3 weeks of PTO to schedule.
[06/05 11:18] <06Amit_zOS> 3 Weeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkkss!!!!!!!!!!
[06/05 11:19] <06Amit_zOS> oh man... I just made up my mind that I will need to go to Alaska
[06/05 11:19] <dsk_hbe> I am that old ;-)  I start off with 38 days - 30 vaca +5 sick+ 3 float.
[06/05 11:19] <dsk_hbe> and I do not waste my days if I can avoid it
[06/05 11:20] <06Amit_zOS> one of my friends just went there for the whole week.. apparently, these days, there is no "night" there.. its always bright!
[06/05 11:20] <dsk_hbe> during a certain time of year, right?  and then all dark at another time?
[06/05 11:20] <06Amit_zOS> and a beautiful place.. the pictures were also good.. yup, night all the time during winters.. maybe an couple of hours of sunlight
[06/05 11:21] <JimE_zOS> and since ERE came from darkness, I'd expect Alaska to be light 
[06/05 11:22] <06Amit_zOS> :)
[06/05 11:22] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, still haven't gotten to see your Europe pictures!
[06/05 11:23] <JimE_zOS> yeah, Amazon only lets me share the "album" with 5 people. 
[06/05 11:23] <JimE_zOS> so I'm looking for other alternatives. 
[06/05 11:23] <06Amit_zOS> :(
[06/05 11:24] <06Amit_zOS> Upload them on FB!
[06/05 11:24] <02charlie> jim doesnt do fb
[06/05 11:24] <triveni> insta
[06/05 11:24] <triveni> ;)
[06/05 11:24] <triveni> #jimandEurope
[06/05 11:25] <JimE_zOS> I gotta be careful.  Don't want to blow-up the internet. :-)
[06/05 11:25] <triveni> Jim instagram needs you :D
[06/05 11:27] <06Amit_zOS> THen maybe change your photo on people's hub..!
[06/05 11:28] <06Amit_zOS> Let em see the new you!
[06/05 11:28] <triveni> I don't think he has a pic there
[06/05 11:28] <06Amit_zOS> All the more reason
[06/05 11:31] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah, I can't put my picture in peopleHub.  
[06/05 11:31] <JimE_zOS> just not done when you have a track record of being so old fashioned. 
[06/05 11:32] <06Amit_zOS> Big whoop! Who care's!? I vote you should do it anyway!
[06/05 11:32] <06Amit_zOS> :P
[06/05 11:33] <JimE_zOS> blowing-up the intrAnet is hardly better than blowing-up the intERnet. 
[06/05 11:33] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/05 11:33] <triveni> baby steps
[06/05 11:33] <triveni> will target intrAnet first
[06/05 11:34] <triveni> and then cover the undiscoverd planets as well
[06/05 11:34] <triveni> ;)
[06/05 11:34] <06Amit_zOS> its like our test system.. fabc
[06/05 11:34] <06Amit_zOS> who cares if you blow up fabc... your words.. not mine! :D
[06/05 11:34] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/05 11:34] <dsk_hbe> they're scaring me, Jim ;-)
[06/05 11:35] <JimE_zOS> ok, #theRock was a joke.  Go back to cosTrainZOS so we can discuss old age in peace :-)
[06/05 11:35] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/05 11:35] <02charlie> lol
[06/05 11:35] <dsk_hbe> ;-)

[06/05 11:38] <02charlie> ww, sorry
[06/05 11:38] * Retrieving #theRock modes...
[06/05 11:42] <triveni> thanks charlie
[06/05 11:43] <triveni> i saved it :)
[06/05 11:43] <02charlie> it's on people hub
[06/05 11:45] <triveni> debbie, i wanted to know how do you identify its an eclipse search
[06/05 11:46] <triveni> i was trying to find abline in yesterday's diary.. not sure whether it will be still dere.
[06/05 11:46] <dsk_hbe> in the case of the ticket I own, it's because the eclipse daily processing application failed it.  The ablines are in SDIGPM.  SDI is another name for the Classic Eclipse system
[06/05 11:47] <triveni> ok
[06/05 11:47] <triveni> I ll keep a note of SDI then.
[06/05 11:47] <dsk_hbe> and it is such an old, virtually obsolete system, that I likely won't spend much time trying to train you guys on it.
[06/05 11:47] <triveni> ok
[06/05 11:49] <dsk_hbe> in fact what I am contemplating on this current issue is basically ignoring it.  I found a code bug that just waited for our menus to grow big enough to hit it... wayne agreed with my findings.  What I am thinking of doing is locking searches and only doing anythign about them if a user complains.  All internals and odds are very few even realize they still have searches in thsi old system
[06/05 11:50] <triveni> its a scheduled search right?
[06/05 11:50] <triveni> do they run daily..
[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> it's not like the PQS system.  For classic eclipse, the searches all run in the morning in the same batch.
[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> we used to have things called intra-days, but none of those anymore
[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> there are only 1,039 classic eclipse searches left out there
[06/05 11:52] <triveni> ok
[06/05 11:52] <dsk_hbe> IN PQS land it's not unusual for a single user to have that many of his own ;-)
[06/05 11:53] <triveni> and they use SA copies
[06/05 11:53] <triveni> or SR copies
[06/05 11:53] <triveni> i mean the eclipse searches
[06/05 11:53] <dsk_hbe> the searches are kicked off in teh LSA, but still do the actual search processing via the LSR
[06/05 11:54] <triveni> ok 
[06/05 11:56] <06Amit_zOS> I didn't know that eclipse is a different class of search itself.. was under the impression that eclipse is a system that carried out the PQS searches
[06/05 11:57] <dsk_hbe> well, in teh web/PQS world, they do call their searches PQs (persistent queries)... but in Classic Eclipse we just call ours Eclipses... why do you need two names? ;-) 
[06/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> you have to remember that Classic was around much longer than the web world... some naming conventions got carried forward as they built the web products, some they changed just to be different ;-)
[06/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> or some other less politically correct word ;-)
[06/05 11:58] <06Amit_zOS> so under the hood, both are the same really
[06/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> basically yep
[06/05 11:59] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/05 12:02] <JimE_zOS> both. 
[06/05 12:02] <JimE_zOS> ignore me. 
[06/05 12:03] <JimE_zOS> some well meaning but clueless person has dorked one of my security apps. 
[06/05 12:03] <dsk_hbe> ut oh
[06/05 12:03] <JimE_zOS> working perfectly until....small island nation. 
[06/05 12:03] <dsk_hbe> :-(
[06/05 12:03] <triveni> Amit i forgot..
[06/05 12:03] <JimE_zOS> I've never even talked to this person so there is ZERO chance they understand the application. 
[06/05 12:04] <triveni> i will be taking daytime
[06/05 12:04] <triveni> this week
[06/05 12:04] <JimE_zOS> and, no biggie, it just deletes TSO/USS accounts so what could go wrong? 
[06/05 12:04] <triveni> i removed you..
[06/05 12:04] <dsk_hbe> how could they even touch your stuff???
[06/05 12:05] <JimE_zOS> unfortunately, they retained access because they provision ROSCOE and IDMS. 
[06/05 12:05] <dsk_hbe> :-(
[06/05 12:06] <JimE_zOS> even if I took over IDMS (which I don't want), I refuse to take on Roscoe. 
[06/05 12:07] <06Amit_zOS> Are you gonna hunt him down, and kill his privileges??
[06/05 12:07] <dsk_hbe> I always thought our Roscoe accesses were tied to TSO in the same way
[06/05 12:07] <JimE_zOS> small island nation so in Manila. 
[06/05 12:07] <JimE_zOS> hunting people down used to be a face-to-face discussion/explanation/confrontation. 
[06/05 12:07] <06Amit_zOS> By way of sharing, thats a 'Taken' movie reference.. lol
[06/05 12:07] <JimE_zOS> that era is certainly gone. 
[06/05 12:08] <JimE_zOS> "small island nation"? 
[06/05 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> no, "hunt him down, and kill him"
[06/05 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> with a slight adjustment
[06/05 12:09] <02charlie> lol
[06/05 12:10] <02charlie> yeah, i got the taken reference
[06/05 12:10] <02charlie> i tend to watch those Quakerly films :)
[06/05 12:10] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/05 12:10] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie!! Your awesome!
[06/05 12:10] <triveni> well that pharse is a cliche..
[06/05 12:11] <02charlie> no, jim is awesome
[06/05 12:11] <triveni> used in almost all the criminal mystery tvshows dese days
[06/05 12:11] <06Amit_zOS> .....as a movie reference
[06/05 12:12] <triveni> debbie.. m trying to understand..what happened in that ticket
[06/05 12:12] <dsk_hbe> in the eclipse ticket?
[06/05 12:12] <triveni> because of the promotions..i mean the database promotions
[06/05 12:12] <triveni> it wasn't avaialbe.
[06/05 12:13] <triveni> availlable**
[06/05 12:13] <triveni> yes the eclipse ticket.
[06/05 12:13] <dsk_hbe> right now before classic eclipse starts we turn off promotions.  Thsi is a very old deal related to making sure that all users get the same answers to their searches out of eclipse.
[06/05 12:13] <triveni> yes makes sense
[06/05 12:13] <dsk_hbe> so we didn't want data updating after one user's search ran and before the next user's same search ran.
[06/05 12:14] <dsk_hbe> Given we have no billables anymore, we think that is no longer needed... so that's why I asked Doug abotu not turning off promotes anymore.
[06/05 12:15] <triveni> ok..
[06/05 12:15] <triveni> but the incident happened coz the promotions failed..
[06/05 12:15] <triveni> ?
[06/05 12:15] <06Amit_zOS> Whats the hitch in doing away with Eclipse then? Infrastructure dependencies? 
[06/05 12:16] <dsk_hbe> no, teh incident happened because we abended 3 eclipses for teh same abline... a code bug.
[06/05 12:16] <triveni> ohh
[06/05 12:16] <dsk_hbe> no hitch other than some internals CLAIM they still need them... they need to be re-programmed ;-)
[06/05 12:17] <06Amit_zOS> I see..
[06/05 12:17] <dsk_hbe> the internals that is ;-)
[06/05 12:17] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[06/05 12:17] <triveni> what we are doing then.. are we going to fix the code..
[06/05 12:17] <triveni> or its ok let them fail.
[06/05 12:17] <triveni> it happens very less
[06/05 12:17] <triveni> so we can ignore?
[06/05 12:17] <dsk_hbe> that was my dicussion earlier, Triveni... about ignoring it... re-read that and see if you have more questions, ok?
[06/05 12:18] <triveni> ok 
[06/05 12:19] <dsk_hbe> there is more to it than just ignoring it... I'm still thinking about how to make that seemless
[06/05 12:20] <triveni> ok..
[06/05 12:26] <triveni> debbie.. i was trying to understand your and vickie's conversation.
[06/05 12:27] <triveni> just wanted to know.. negative news ablines are identified by NN
[06/05 12:27] <triveni> like SNNNEW
[06/05 12:27] <02charlie> yes, snnnew is handling nn 
[06/05 12:27] <dsk_hbe> I can't understand it myself... she and Joe claimed that SNNNEW ablines were a big concern at her meeting... wasn't clear to me at the time was that it applied to all Diligence users, not just the ones who the web folks had turned on the Fuzzy search ability for.
[06/05 12:27] <02charlie> notice we had about 83 of them
[06/05 12:28] <dsk_hbe> there are more modules than SNNNEW, I think, involved in negative news processing, but it is certainly one
[06/05 12:28] <dsk_hbe> yeah, Charlie, they tried way too many times :-/
[06/05 12:28] <dsk_hbe> and since these ar BG searches, the odds of many, many parcels per search are good, so many, many ablines
[06/05 12:28] <02charlie> my memory was correct, i just went and checked, 83
[06/05 12:29] <02charlie> SNNNEW+00010 NERJSGAB NNEWS SEGMENT LOGIC ERROR
[06/05 12:29] <triveni> ok..
[06/05 12:38] <triveni> I wanted to know.. the allocation of number of fg and bg parcels defines the speed of the searches. 
[06/05 12:40] <dsk_hbe> well, it can add to it but by no means is the only factor.  Search priority, BG copy prioirty, abuser settings, etc.  I am sure I am not thinking of everything... Charlie and Jim might add mroe
[06/05 12:40] <triveni> i meant..what does the parcel values are responsible for?
[06/05 12:40] <triveni> ok
[06/05 12:41] <dsk_hbe> which parcel values... the number given to a search or the count we set in fcards?
[06/05 12:41] <triveni> yes
[06/05 12:41] <triveni> exactly
[06/05 12:41] <triveni> fcards
[06/05 12:42] <dsk_hbe> the numbers in facrds tell us how many databases may be searched in a FG or BG parcel... max is 95 for FG, 165 for BG
[06/05 12:43] <triveni> ok..
[06/05 12:43] <02charlie> i am going to run and get something from my sister
[06/05 12:44] <triveni> Thanks debbie..
[06/05 12:44] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/05 12:44] <02charlie> someone want to be triveni's buddy
[06/05 12:44] <02charlie> ?
[06/05 12:44] <dsk_hbe> sure
[06/05 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> 2 PARCELSIZE=095 165                                          FD
[06/05 12:45] <02charlie> thx
[06/05 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> This?
[06/05 12:45] <dsk_hbe> yep

[06/05 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks
[06/05 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> whats with the FD label at the right? meant for LFD?
[06/05 12:46] <dsk_hbe> yep
[06/05 12:46] <dsk_hbe> he's teh one that decides how many parcels to send down to the LSRs and so has to be the one to know how many DBs to put in each
[06/05 12:46] <06Amit_zOS> pl
[06/05 12:46] <06Amit_zOS> *ok
[06/05 12:46] <dsk_hbe> ;-)

[06/05 14:48] <JimE_zOS> made a stop by Change Mgt.  I'm brewing an idea RE: critical rename cancelations. 
[06/05 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/05 14:53] <JimE_zOS> and before I forget, I've updated the OPC calendars for the July 4th holiday: 
[06/05 14:53] <JimE_zOS> SE001CRN$IMF$GRP Menu/IMF CRN Exception Dates  
[06/05 14:53] <JimE_zOS> SE001CRN$SHP$GRP ShepTable CRN Exception Dates

[06/05 14:54] <02charlie> thx jim
[06/05 14:54] <JimE_zOS> when we get closer to the holiday, I'm sure Bobbie K will send an email/ticket. 
[06/05 14:54] <JimE_zOS> I'd guess this is what she will want. 
[06/05 14:55] <JimE_zOS> k....now to my coding. 
[06/05 15:06] <dsk_hbe> thx, Jim!
[06/05 15:23] <dsk_hbe> can you guys see the incident list in service now 'homepage' anymore?  it says there are 7 but isn't listign them for me
[06/05 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> i can see
[06/05 15:23] <02charlie> yes
[06/05 15:24] <dsk_hbe> bizarre
[06/05 15:24] <dsk_hbe> I killed the browser and tried again and still nothing
[06/05 15:24] <02charlie> and im showing 8
[06/05 15:24] <02charlie> well, one is the stask
[06/05 15:24] <dsk_hbe> I was only asking about incidents, I can see the stask
[06/05 15:24] <02charlie> which i guess i should close :)
[06/05 15:28] <dsk_hbe> well Doug didn't tell me anything I didn't know but his note was pretty ;-)
[06/05 15:28] <JimE_zOS> I told you to expect colors :-)
[06/05 15:30] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/05 15:31] <dsk_hbe> since I can't seemed to get service now to tell me my ticket number, woudl someone tell me what it is for this email I am writing... stupid tool
[06/05 15:32] <JimE_zOS> INC01552942		10:50:00 LSA04 59 ECL-THE ECLIPSE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE *** 10:50:00 LSA03 59 ECL-THE ECLIPSE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE ***
[06/05 15:32] <dsk_hbe> thanks, Jim!
[06/05 15:32] <JimE_zOS> certainly 
[06/05 15:32] <dsk_hbe> I'll try a reboot after this and see if it fixes it but I have my doubts
[06/05 15:40] <02charlie> sheesh, my basement is getting flooded
[06/05 15:40] <dsk_hbe> oh no :-(
[06/05 15:41] <02charlie> and people are worried about the rug, and im just want them to concentrate on getting teh water out first
[06/05 15:45] <dsk_hbe> gonnq reboot. brb

[06/05 15:51] <dsk_away> as I suspect... it dind't help... somehow my account is hosed
[06/05 15:52] <06Amit_zOS> did you try in different browsers?
[06/05 15:52] <dsk_away> yep
[06/05 15:52] <dsk_away> that's why I suspected a reboot wouldn't help since none of the browsers liked me either
[06/05 15:53] <dsk_away> I guess I will mess with this later.  I need to run an errand before oncall.
[06/05 15:53] <06Amit_zOS> Strange
[06/05 15:54] <dsk_away> you guys have a good evening!!

[06/06 10:21] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[06/06 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim!
[06/06 10:22] <dsk_hbe> hiya, Jim
[06/06 10:22] <02charlie> while i have everyone here, i want to let you know i'm going to leave about 1115-1130 tomorrow to run an errand for about an hour
[06/06 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Cool!
[06/06 10:23] <dsk_hbe> so you are taking lunch?  that's allowed ;-)
[06/06 10:23] <02charlie> :)
[06/06 10:23] <triveni> :)
[06/06 10:24] <02charlie> lol: I decided it would be a shame to not make use of it
[06/06 10:24] <dsk_hbe> they sure aren't paying you any extra to not take a lunch ;-)
[06/06 10:27] <JimE_zOS> you know, I've noticed that. 
[06/06 10:27] <02charlie> lol
[06/06 10:28] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/06 10:29] <02charlie> that B11N19 is a persistent person for sure :)
[06/06 10:33] <JimE_zOS> splash of coffee then coding. 
[06/06 10:33] <JimE_zOS> BRB 
[06/06 10:38] <02charlie> i would recommend doing the ios upgrade only when your phone is fully charged or connected to power, and when you're not oncall. it's been 10 minutes, by my guess. i wasnt timing it
[06/06 10:38] <02charlie> and still going
[06/06 10:38] <02charlie> maybe 15 now
[06/06 10:39] <02charlie> its been more than 10 since debbie's not and i started mine before then
[06/06 10:39] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I change NOTHING when oncall if I can help it ;-)
[06/06 10:39] <02charlie> yeah, me too
[06/06 10:40] <02charlie> but i am connected and i have my personal phone as an alternate, and forgot that i have daytime :)
[06/06 10:40] <02charlie> ooow, the passcode screen has a different tint
[06/06 10:41] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, daytime doesn't factor in for me either since I have pages route to my personal phoen as well
[06/06 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> i have it setup the same way debbie!
[06/06 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/06 10:43] <dsk_hbe> good... we used to miss pages A LOT... not so much recently... but it forced many of us not to trust our paging tools ;-)
[06/06 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> Good that you snow troubles are temporarily subdued
[06/06 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> :D
[06/06 10:45] <dsk_hbe> wise use of 'temporary', Amit... until the next one ;-)
[06/06 10:48] <JimE_zOS> back. 
[06/06 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> guys, this i suppose is a question i should have asked way earlier but is Nexis also search engine?
[06/06 10:48] <JimE_zOS> got an earful from Rita Peters and Carson Rains RE: July Oracle upgrade of SDS 
[06/06 10:48] <JimE_zOS> be very afraid. 
[06/06 10:49] <02charlie> ugh
[06/06 10:50] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure we will hear more but they are already concerned about differences between prod and cert and the ability to test prior to upgrade. 
[06/06 10:50] <02charlie> lovely
[06/06 10:51] <JimE_zOS> also mentioned that Rajesh upgraded the SDS client and it failed. 
[06/06 10:51] <JimE_zOS> so here is what we are going to do....
[06/06 10:51] <JimE_zOS> the week of the upgrade, we are going to insist on a metadata freeze. 
[06/06 10:52] <JimE_zOS> so that when SDS changes, only oracle is changing, not the metadata content. 
[06/06 10:52] <JimE_zOS> which will also mean no metadata backouts. 
[06/06 10:52] <02charlie> makes excellent sense to me
[06/06 10:52] <JimE_zOS> which is why nobody will agree to do it. 
[06/06 10:52] <02charlie> lol
[06/06 10:52] <02charlie> when is the oracle upgrade scheduled?
[06/06 10:53] <JimE_zOS> I just know July, Charlie.
[06/06 10:53] <JimE_zOS> no specific date known to me at this time. 
[06/06 10:53] <02charlie> ive got bcp in 7 minutes, brb
[06/06 10:54] <06Amit_ZOS> so then does it mean we will be cancelling renames?
[06/06 11:07] <dsk_hbe> thanks for teh Oracle info, Jim... makes me worry abotu zlfd too... that stuff just scares me anyway since I know so little 
[06/06 11:07] <dsk_hbe> ORacle, not zlfd... I know a little more there ;-)
[06/06 11:13] <dsk_hbe> Amit/Triveni - question from Anita... have you used any of the web-based apps, lexis.com, rosetta, etc?
[06/06 11:13] <dsk_hbe> oh sorry, didn't notice Jim was on the email... he kenw the answer :-)
[06/06 11:14] <06Amit_ZOS> we did a few searches to check for bad documents in cert-lexis.co,
[06/06 11:14] <06Amit_ZOS> com*
[06/06 11:14] <dsk_hbe> cool
[06/06 11:14] <06Amit_ZOS> does that count?
[06/06 11:17] <dsk_hbe> it does

[06/06 13:40] <dsk_hbe> before I foget, I will need to leave right at 3pm to get to an appointment.  I expect to be back before oncall hits with no problem

[06/06 13:41] <dsk_hbe> I appreciate that.  I doubt it will be needed but will text you if somethign delays me.  Thanks!!

[06/06 14:07] <02charlie> :D

[06/06 14:08] <JimE_zOS> back. 
[06/06 14:09] <dsk_hbe> how are the issues going, Jim?  better yet?
[06/06 14:14] <JimE_zOS> my jaw is better.  Still can't open to normal extention (you know....like 'Mummy' mouth), but better. 
[06/06 14:14] <JimE_zOS> no more appointments needed unless the progress stops. 
[06/06 14:14] <JimE_zOS> or this lingers for more than another week or two. 
[06/06 14:14] <dsk_hbe> :-(  I hope it is all better soon.
[06/06 14:15] <02charlie> yes
[06/06 14:15] <JimE_zOS> ditto.  I'm off my normal meal schedule.  Can't eat a salad with this jaw pain. 
[06/06 14:15] <dsk_hbe> ugh
[06/06 14:16] <06Amit_zOS> Get well soon Jim!
[06/06 14:16] <JimE_zOS> before I forget to say this, tomorrow at lunch time, I need to run ERE to Children's Hospital (she is a translator/scribe). 
[06/06 14:17] <JimE_zOS> won't linger so should be back around 1pm. 
[06/06 14:17] <JimE_zOS> she is picking up her new (to her) car after work tomorrow. 
[06/06 14:17] <JimE_zOS> which, I hope, willl be the last of our car sharing issues for the summer. 
[06/06 14:17] <dsk_hbe> not fun for sure
[06/06 14:18] <JimE_zOS> KRE and ERE will have their own cars and we have a "kid" car for William. 
[06/06 14:18] <JimE_zOS> 5 drivers, 5 cars ought to be enough. 
[06/06 14:18] <02charlie> hopefully
[06/06 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> goodness
[06/06 14:19] <JimE_zOS> oh, maybe Triveni can keep track of the mileage for all of those too.

[06/07 09:23] <02charlie> good morning amit
[06/07 09:24] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Charlie!
[06/07 09:37] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[06/07 09:37] <dsk_hbe> morning
[06/07 09:37] <02charlie> good morning debbie
[06/07 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Debbie!
[06/07 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> OPC problems at a bad time!?? did it affect us?
[06/07 09:38] <02charlie> doesnt appear to have
[06/07 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> We were not paged for this right?
[06/07 09:39] <02charlie> correct
[06/07 09:39] <dsk_hbe> I was just checkign OPC... I didn't get a page so Doug must have gotten things bounced with better timing than last time... that or he cleaned up all of our broken stuff quickly.  I'll email him back.
[06/07 09:39] <02charlie> yeah, we have nothing that shows up in 5.4
[06/07 09:39] <dsk_hbe> and, btw, second time this has happened, both with me oncall... I think I'm a jinx and shoudl be excused from oncall duties right away
[06/07 09:40] <02charlie> lol
[06/07 09:40] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.
[06/07 09:40] <dsk_hbe> it woudln't be a 5.4 thing, Charlie... if they got stymied and didn't report back to OPC, jobs would still be sitting in OPC in started status.  If it fell like last time
[06/07 09:40] <02charlie> yeah, peculiar that they both occurred at 0019
[06/07 09:40] <02charlie> oh, yeah, doh!
[06/07 09:41] <dsk_hbe> like I said last time... creating the kind of mess that we get every BCP test :-p
[06/07 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> they were stuck in the started status he said..
[06/07 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> does that mean the jobs had not actually started even though OPC said it did?
[06/07 09:42] <dsk_hbe> no they started, completed, but could not report back
[06/07 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> so then doug must have manually completed them?
[06/07 09:43] <dsk_hbe> likely
[06/07 09:43] <02charlie> these are the only items we own in started status, and i believe these should be ok:
[06/07 09:43] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/07 09:43] <02charlie> Application                                 Input arrival   S   P  G  Add

[06/07 09:43] <dsk_hbe> right
[06/07 09:43] <dsk_hbe> well, aside fromt eh LDM stuff
[06/07 09:43] <dsk_hbe> I checked prod, dw, fabc, c1
[06/07 09:44] * charlie_away has joined #theRock
[06/07 09:44] * ChanServ sets mode: +o charlie_away
[06/07 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> there is some cert stuff in error list though
[06/07 09:44] <charlie_away> dont know what that was about
[06/07 09:45] <charlie_away> i used SE%%* as my mask, status of S and date from 17/06/07
[06/07 09:46] <dsk_hbe> much like diaries, I don't tend to limit the field I'm looking at... you never know if somethng that started way earlier the day before might have gotten stuck
[06/07 09:47] <charlie_away> good point
[06/07 09:47] <charlie_away> i also looked at 6/6 but still nothing there that shouldnt have been there (C1 dataspaces)
[06/07 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> what does add func with 'E' signify?
[06/07 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> how was it added?
[06/07 09:49] * charlie has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 366 seconds)
[06/07 09:49] <charlie_away> by soe commands
[06/07 09:49] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[06/07 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> SOE?
[06/07 09:49] <02charlie> it was added dynamically by another application
[06/07 09:50] <02charlie> i dont even remember what soe stands for, jim probably does
[06/07 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> i added the owner E00C00 and  i found these:
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> SEUPLNP$DYNAMIC   LNP Dynamic Maint (Prod)
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> SEUPLNP$STATIC    LNP Static Maint (Prod)
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> SEUPSMRWCHLDDLY   PROD SmartWatch Load Dly
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> SE881START$DW     Start DW OLS
[06/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> SE99FABC$START    FABC Start
[06/07 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> status of all of them is S
[06/07 09:52] <02charlie> SE88 is the correct status
[06/07 09:53] <02charlie> ie, SE881START$DW should be S
[06/07 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> you mean the others should have been marked completed?
[06/07 09:53] <02charlie> dont know about the SEUP ones, i think those might be fabsup's
[06/07 09:54] <02charlie> but as i said previously the SE99 ones are in correct status
[06/07 09:54] <dsk_hbe> they aren't ours certainl... LNP likely middleware
[06/07 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> Question: how do you know if they are in correct status or not? are you basing this by going and looking if the jobs were completed successfully?
[06/07 09:57] <02charlie> good question
[06/07 09:58] <dsk_hbe> likely... can't speak fro what Doug did, but likely
[06/07 09:59] <06Amit_ZOS> is that what you did charlie when you said that SE88 and SE99 were in correct status?
[06/07 09:59] <02charlie> (1) the input arrival times of the jobs dont match with the incident times (2) they are the FABC and DW start jobs, which should be in started status while those are running
[06/07 09:59] <dsk_hbe> meeting time
[06/07 09:59] <02charlie> and fabc and dw are up and running
[06/07 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Debbie! Can we help out with the release again ?? 
[06/07 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> When is it exactly?
[06/07 10:16] <dsk_hbe> Sunday morning, they're always Sunday morning unless something bizarre is goig on.
[06/07 10:18] <triveni> what is a master dictionary?
[06/07 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> Cool!
[06/07 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> So we'r up for a late saturday night this week!
[06/07 10:21] <dsk_hbe> sorry, I have a couple distractions hitting me this morning.  I'll let Charlie explain Master Dictionary if he has time... as to the release... you are welcome to watch over my shoulder, help with diary checkout, etc., but as far as prepping it, I have a need to do this myself so I make sure I have my head down and don't miss a step... just me and how I work.  
[06/07 10:22] <dsk_hbe> I'll be online around 1am SUnday morning and you are sure welcome!!!
[06/07 10:22] <02charlie> sorry, missed the question
[06/07 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> Will do Debbie.. :)
[06/07 10:23] <02charlie> master dictionary, i'll give you my version, which is probably wrong and debbie and jim will have to clean up the mess i make :)
[06/07 10:23] <02charlie> here goes
[06/07 10:24] <dsk_hbe> I am sure you will do just fine, thanks!  I need to turn away from irc for a bit to get a few things done.  Say my name if you need my attention!
[06/07 10:25] <02charlie> i believe MD is for caselaw DBs only

[06/07 10:27] <02charlie> MD is an attempt to speed up the search process by indexing terms in those dbs included in the MD into a common DB, so that they can get the results faster 
[06/07 10:28] <02charlie> did you see my 10:25 post?
[06/07 10:28] <triveni> caselaw DBs only
[06/07 10:29] <02charlie> yes

[06/07 10:40] <JimE_zOS> you could probably pull off sneaky.  Nobody who talks so freely has anything to hide.

[06/07 13:47] <JimE_zOS> and why would a UJFCOPY be an online dataset (PL) anyway?

[06/07 15:08] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni just asked me.... "Hey, did you learn how to run ERE!??" I burst out laughing.. She thinks ERE is a Job!
[06/07 15:08] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/07 15:09] <triveni> I dont understand..why is that funny?
[06/07 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> she still has no clue what ERE is
[06/07 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> what/who!
[06/07 15:09] <02charlie> and Children's is the hospital
[06/07 15:10] <triveni> ERE = Jim
[06/07 15:10] <triveni> ohh JIm's daughter
[06/07 15:10] <02charlie> ERE is jim's daughter
[06/07 15:10] <triveni> amit just needs something to laugh.. he could have just told that to me.
[06/07 15:10] <02charlie> and about that same time i was running Grace to Childrens as well
[06/07 15:11] <triveni> ok..
[06/07 15:31] <06Amit_zOS> SE001CHK$HCSINBD in error list
[06/07 15:32] <06Amit_zOS> problem with HCS connections?
[06/07 15:33] <JimE_zOS> possibly.  
[06/07 15:33] <JimE_zOS> didn't psc2825 have issues earlier today? 
[06/07 15:34] <JimE_zOS> might check the output of the failed job to see which box had trouble. 
[06/07 15:36] <06Amit_zOS> load_hostkeys: loading entries for host "psc2825" from file
[06/07 15:37] <JimE_zOS> if we have had a clean run on psc2825 since that inital failure, I think you could just complete the failed application
[06/07 15:38] <02charlie> jim, where were you taking elizabeth?
[06/07 15:39] <JimE_zOS> Dayton Children's.  She works there as a translator/scribe. 
[06/07 15:39] <triveni> RC=0255
[06/07 15:39] <triveni> for 13:30 run
[06/07 15:39] <02charlie> ah, i was taking grace to cincinnati childrens
[06/07 15:40] <JimE_zOS> sure, Triveni.  But have we had a good, clean run on psc2825 since that failure? 
[06/07 15:40] <triveni> psc2825
[06/07 15:40] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I got the box name. 
[06/07 15:41] <JimE_zOS> have we had a clean run on that box since the initial failure? 
[06/07 15:41] <triveni> connection timed out
[06/07 15:41] <triveni> it says
[06/07 15:41] <JimE_zOS> I don't care why it failed. 
[06/07 15:41] <JimE_zOS> I know why it failed...the box was down. 
[06/07 15:41] <triveni> ok
[06/07 15:41] <JimE_zOS> have we had a clean run on that box since the initial failure? 
[06/07 15:42] <triveni> after tht it had clean runs
[06/07 15:42] <triveni> 14.30 and 15.30 runs are clean
[06/07 15:42] <JimE_zOS> that's the part that matters. 
[06/07 15:42] <triveni> so should i just remove it from opc's error list
[06/07 15:43] <06Amit_zOS> Yes we have had clean runs
[06/07 15:43] <JimE_zOS> k...given that data, I think you can safely complete the earlier failed application. 
[06/07 15:43] <triveni> ok
[06/07 15:43] <triveni> on it..
[06/07 15:43] <triveni> i ll do a 'CMP'
[06/07 15:44] <JimE_zOS> yeah...CMP is fine for that. 
[06/07 15:44] <triveni> ok

[06/08 09:41] <triveni> mirc log
[06/08 09:41] <triveni> how to send page.
[06/08 09:41] <triveni> i think u taught us once..
[06/08 09:41] <02charlie> mirc log would be in several different places
[06/08 09:42] <dsk_hbe> I always use the casenet 'sendpage' command.  You have to know everyone's ID to use it though... so to send me a test page you'd enter:
[06/08 09:42] <dsk_hbe> sendpage kamburds test
[06/08 09:42] <02charlie> (1) C:\Users\<your id>\App Data\Remote\Mirc|logs
[06/08 09:42] <dsk_hbe> if you put more than one word in the text you need to surround it with quotes and some characters sendpage doesn't like... trial and error there.
[06/08 09:43] <triveni> ok lemme try
[06/08 09:44] <02charlie> (2) Logs can be found at \\lngdaydatp003\SSPublic in "Release logs", "SSlogs"; Also at: \\lngdaydatp003\sysspt\Infoshare n Tools\irclogs
[06/08 09:45] <dsk_hbe> I got it... well on my personal devices... good hting we use those as backups :-/
[06/08 09:45] <02charlie> the other way to send her a page is to go to xmatters
[06/08 09:46] <dsk_hbe> she was likely looking for costrain logs, Charlie, which we don't log externally.  and you can change the location of where you log your own, if you log your own.  I send mine to my external harddrive
[06/08 09:46] <dsk_hbe> I was gettign there Charlie, but feel free to take over... I need to go check my stats
[06/08 09:46] <02charlie> sure
[06/08 09:47] <triveni> thanks debbie..
[06/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> my work phone finally got your page Triveni... it looked ot be strugglign to connect to the world for some reason
[06/08 09:47] <triveni> charlie..yes i would like to know from how to page from xmatters as well..
[06/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, a simple 'HELP' will get my attention if you are in a panic ;-)  sendpage, sadly, does not like exclamation points ;-)
[06/08 09:48] <triveni> ok debbie!! :))
[06/08 10:00] <triveni> thanks Charlie!!

[06/08 16:09] <triveni> bye debbie!!
[06/08 16:09] <JimE_zOS> bye, Debbie
[06/08 16:09] <dsk_away> Yeah, think Eri told us about the job swap thing at a staffer a while back... asked if anyone else was interested... I suspect the answer was no ;-)
[06/08 16:09] <dsk_away> ok, bye!!!!
[06/08 16:10] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I'm going to OPS.....not,
[06/08 16:10] <02charlie> lol
[06/08 16:29] <06Amit_zOS> for more dramatic effect, you should have put NOT
[06/08 16:47] <06Amit_zOS> Just heard the whole story from Eric regarding the 12+ hrs of 360 outtage..
[06/08 16:48] <02charlie> yes?
[06/08 16:48] <06Amit_zOS> Jim should have been here to hear it..
[06/08 16:48] <06Amit_zOS> Apparently they still don't know what caused it
[06/08 16:48] <06Amit_zOS> nor do they know how they fixed it..
[06/08 16:49] <06Amit_zOS> initially they tried bouncing antidote(their search engine) -- no good, bounced servers-no good, bounced a bunch of other stuff--no good..
[06/08 16:50] <JimE_zOS> is this the place I point out that when you use some 3rd party search engine, you are at their mercy. 
[06/08 16:50] <06Amit_zOS> finally they had to shut down the all the application yesterday at about 7 pm 
[06/08 16:51] <triveni> well its working now
[06/08 16:51] <JimE_zOS> when you own the search engine...and have all of the source code, you can take care of yourself. 
[06/08 16:51] <triveni> they are trying to dig their logs
[06/08 16:51] <06Amit_zOS> and they started turning things up and found that they were running fine then
[06/08 16:51] <JimE_zOS> swell. 
[06/08 16:51] <JimE_zOS> success inspite of ourselves.  Exactly what this group does not tolerate. 
[06/08 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> i could here Jim whispering, this is why we don't just blindly bounce stuff... we think, consider and act...lol
[06/08 16:52] <02charlie> yep
[06/08 16:52] <02charlie> is l360 the french product?
[06/08 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/08 16:52] <triveni>  french and austria
[06/08 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> antidote also french i think
[06/08 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> apparently they had a 2hr call today morning
[06/08 16:53] <triveni> ok people.. i ll be leaving
[06/08 16:53] <triveni> bye everyone!!
[06/08 16:53] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[06/08 16:53] <02charlie> bye triveni
[06/08 16:53] <06Amit_zOS> Seeya triveni, im sticking around to listen to Jim's comments!
[06/08 16:53] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/08 16:54] <JimE_zOS> I'm done.  And your comment makes it clear that I have already conveyed my thoughts.  
[06/08 16:54] <JimE_zOS> think, consider, act. 
[06/08 16:54] <06Amit_zOS> :)
[06/08 16:54] <JimE_zOS> an excellent summary 
[06/08 16:54] <02charlie> :D
[06/08 16:55] <JimE_zOS> a rare approach, but the only correct one if you want a stable product. 
[06/08 16:56] <06Amit_zOS> I agree Jim, if i am to build my own product, i will take that advice to practice!

[06/09 10:11] <dsk_hbe> okie dokie
[06/09 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/09 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, basic q... whats the difference between Jsearch and Qsearch?
[06/09 10:13] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 368 seconds)
[06/09 10:14] * triveni has joined #theRock
[06/09 10:14] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[06/09 10:14] <dsk_hbe> jsearch is a single app that is part of the zlfd suite.  It really doesn't do a ton of work.  JNorm is the powerhorse when it comes to zlfd's search processing.  JSearch is a bit of a passthru.
[06/09 10:15] <dsk_hbe> Qsrch is a TA app... so very diffrent from zlfd.  It is the application that funnels all TA/Rosetta/TP/etc. searches through to their needed search engine
[06/09 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> passthru like PCS?
[06/09 10:21] <dsk_hbe> kinda, yeah... different functions, obvioulsy, but it doesn't do a ton
[06/09 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/09 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks :)
[06/09 10:21] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/09 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> The Jnorm search score criteria for classification of fg/bg searches and priority pools is pretty interesting.. 
[06/09 10:25] <dsk_hbe> yes, looking forward to seeign what that does for us
[06/09 10:25] * JimE_zOS has quit IRC (Quit: )
[06/09 10:26] <06Amit_ZOS> Any idea how the search score is calculated?
[06/09 10:29] <dsk_hbe> sure I have an idea... but I'm super busy... let me dig that up for you later, ok?
[06/09 10:29] <06Amit_ZOS> Done

[06/09 11:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Hi Jim!
[06/09 11:38] <dsk_hbe> Hey Jim, I'm still not sure I completely follow Bobbie's note?  Do you understand it better than me?
[06/09 11:50] <JimE_zOS> I'm not sure I do, Debbie. 
[06/09 11:50] <JimE_zOS> notes like that translate to "make sure your phone is charged".
[06/09 11:50] <dsk_hbe> ok, well at least it's not just me... I htink she is talking metadata speak that means not much to me ;-)
[06/09 11:50] <dsk_hbe> LOL, good idea ;-)

[06/09 12:45] <JimE_zOS> just got a call from a new doctor's office....
[06/09 12:45] <JimE_zOS> I'm supposed to go to a specialist RE: my teeth grinding. 
[06/09 12:45] <06Amit_ZOS> we can see you debbie!
[06/09 12:45] <JimE_zOS> hard to get in to see this guy
[06/09 12:45] <JimE_zOS> but they have an opening. 
[06/09 12:45] <dsk_hbe> ugh, I do that too... wake up with such an aching mouth
[06/09 12:46] <JimE_zOS> does anybody mind if I go to a 1:30 appt? 
[06/09 12:46] <dsk_hbe> okbyme, Jim!
[06/09 12:46] <JimE_zOS> back as quickly as I can. 
[06/09 12:46] <triveni> bye Jim
[06/09 12:46] <JimE_zOS> and not leaving now. 
[06/09 12:46] <06Amit_ZOS>  okbyme, Jim!
[06/09 13:09] <JimE_zOS> k....running to appointment.  Back as quickly as I can. 
[06/09 14:33] <JimE_zOS> back. 
[06/09 14:33] <dsk_hbe> are you getting a mouthguard or something more drastic?
[06/09 14:34] <JimE_zOS> it would appear mouthguard, Debbie. 
[06/09 14:34] <06Amit_ZOS> back after house shifting+lunch
[06/09 14:34] <dsk_hbe> good, let me know how that works out for you... I've been resisting... not sure my gag reflex can take it
[06/09 14:35] <JimE_zOS> I used one (self selected, self fit) when I went to Europe and it was fine. 
[06/09 14:35] <JimE_zOS> so I don't expect to have trouble with a professionally fit device. 
[06/09 14:35] <06Amit_ZOS> is mouthgard the same thing that boxers wear during a fight? 
[06/09 14:35] <dsk_hbe> Ive been thinking about getting one retail like that.... mght try it
[06/09 14:36] <dsk_hbe> kinda, but they fit your teeth more I think than the things boxers use
[06/09 14:36] <JimE_zOS> I like mine.  And this doctor was fine with me continuing to use it. 
[06/09 14:36] <JimE_zOS> the question is, will it hold up to grinding. 
[06/09 14:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah..
[06/09 14:37] <dsk_hbe> mine is more of a clenching... I must have the most stressful dreams
[06/09 14:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Take a long vacation Debbie! Go backpacking through Europe!
[06/09 14:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Triveni will take care of the Release!
[06/09 14:42] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/09 14:42] <dsk_hbe> knowing me I might find that more stressful ;-)
[06/09 14:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Not a travel enthusiast?!
[06/09 14:43] <dsk_hbe> not too much... requires someone to plan it all out for me and tell me when to be where
[06/09 14:43] <06Amit_ZOS> Next best thing to OPC.. JRE
[06/09 14:43] <06Amit_ZOS> he can schedule it!
[06/09 14:43] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/09 14:43] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/09 14:44] <JimE_zOS> I think I finally know enough about OPC to learn some of the inner workings/admin details. 
[06/09 14:45] <JimE_zOS> so I listed that as one of my cross training topics. 
[06/09 14:45] <dsk_hbe> into the belly of the beast
[06/09 14:47] <JimE_zOS> something like that, yes. 
[06/09 14:56] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee.  BRB 
[06/09 15:03] <06Amit_ZOS> leaving now..  See you Debbie on Sunday!
[06/09 15:03] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/09 15:04] <dsk_hbe> ok!!

[06/11 00:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Amit_zOS is now up and running!
[06/11 00:36] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/11 00:48] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[06/11 00:48] <dsk_hbe> HI AMit :-)
[06/11 00:49] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Debbie!
[06/11 00:50] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/11 00:54] <06Amit_ZOS> All rested up for tonight?
[06/11 00:56] <dsk_hbe> never... I hate these things.  My sleep doesn't adjust well for them and especially after.
[06/11 00:57] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. It will go well Debbie!
[06/11 00:58] <dsk_hbe> it's my sleep that won't go well... I'll be awake at thsi hour for at least a week afterwards ;-)
[06/11 00:59] <dsk_hbe> be sure to join #zos-release, Amit
[06/11 00:59] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes Debbie
[06/11 01:03] <06Amit_ZOS> So people who have their code being deployed as a part of this release should be joining us there right? Vickie and Wayne?
[06/11 01:04] <dsk_hbe> I never got a reply on that.  IT could be any of Vickie, Wayne, Joe, and Anita.  Vickie has been on vacation this week so she may not join.  It may be one of the others that runs some tests for her.
[06/11 01:05] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/11 01:06] <06Amit_ZOS> I just checked the ID's on the modules in the prepped package.. Only both of them were there i guess
[06/11 01:07] <06Amit_ZOS> We have PCS, LSA, LFD and LSR changes this time around, right?
[06/11 01:09] <dsk_hbe> no, just lfd and lsr, but we always install the entire OLS.
[06/11 01:09] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes
[06/11 01:09] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/11 01:13] <dsk_hbe> are you following along with the release doc?  I have the current copy on our ss-mvs sharepoint under MVS releases; 2017
[06/11 01:13] <dsk_hbe> right now I am confimring that only non-bridge copies are connected to the sysplex
[06/11 01:14] <06Amit_ZOS> Actually, i forgot the release docs at office, I had the printed ones that Jim gave us
[06/11 01:15] <06Amit_ZOS> fetching from sharepoint
[06/11 01:15] <dsk_hbe> we always store the copy for *this* release on the sharepoint, so you can open it up there if you like.
[06/11 01:16] <dsk_hbe> I do something that I don't think Jim or Charlie do... I delete a bunch of the crap that may not be pertinent to this particular release.  So mine will look different than the template Jim gave you.
[06/11 01:16] <dsk_hbe> so you can go here - https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/ssmvs/default.aspx
[06/11 01:16] <dsk_hbe> along the lefthand side choose mvs releases
[06/11 01:16] <dsk_hbe> then releases 2017
[06/11 01:16] <dsk_hbe> then Jun 11
[06/11 01:17] <dsk_hbe> the doc I am using is SS-Online Install Template_R170611
[06/11 01:17] <dsk_hbe> I need to remove that template part fot he name later
[06/11 01:17] <06Amit_ZOS> I already downloaded from that location
[06/11 01:18] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/11 01:19] <dsk_hbe> ok, so under the release night section, I have so far completed steps 1,2,4,5.  I'll go back and do 3 closer to 2am
[06/11 01:19] <dsk_hbe> well, I did 6,7, and kinda already did 8 too ;-)
[06/11 01:21] <dsk_hbe> anyway, all that to say if you like, you can do 4 and 5 yourself if you like.  I use the tmon option

[06/11 01:24] <dsk_hbe> connection trouble?
[06/11 01:24] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/11 01:24] <06Amit_ZOS> it hanged on me
[06/11 01:24] <06Amit_ZOS> no response
[06/11 01:24] <06Amit_ZOS> ok, using tmon..
[06/11 01:24] <dsk_hbe> did you see me say I coudl guide you in doing the tmon check steps if you'd like since we have time nwo before 2am
[06/11 01:25] <06Amit_ZOS> How do I use tmon again?
[06/11 01:25] <dsk_hbe> I don't know for tpx, but I sign in via 'l tmvscc'
[06/11 01:25] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, id like to know that
[06/11 01:25] <06Amit_ZOS> logging out of tsoc now
[06/11 01:26] <dsk_hbe> you have to do that?
[06/11 01:26] <06Amit_ZOS> got to tmon
[06/11 01:26] <06Amit_ZOS> inside tmon now
[06/11 01:26] <06Amit_ZOS> i didn't have to do that really
[06/11 01:26] <dsk_hbe> ok, at the long list of applids, I choose TMVSCC by putting my cursor on it and hitting enter
[06/11 01:27] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/11 01:27] <06Amit_ZOS> 8>
[06/11 01:27] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[06/11 01:27] <dsk_hbe> this will take you tot he primary menu for sysc.  Here, as per the release doc, go to 1.8.5
[06/11 01:27] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/11 01:27] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/11 01:28] <dsk_hbe> here you will see a bunch of stuff listed... page down until you get to the ones named LSRREQPRODCL**
[06/11 01:28] <dsk_hbe> first one we care about is the cluster one LSRREQPRODCL01XB
[06/11 01:29] <dsk_hbe> see the Usr# column?  it has a 20 in it.  put your cursor on that and hit enter
[06/11 01:29] <06Amit_ZOS> I see it
[06/11 01:29] <dsk_hbe> thsi is a list of all prod copies connected to the cl1 sysplex.  what we need to make sure of is that none of these are bridge copies.
[06/11 01:31] <dsk_hbe> so, the only thing we see are SAP (LSA) copies, FDP9* (CL9 LFDs), FDP80J and FDP89G, the two WSK copies, and the 4 LSRs that are x2, x3, x7, and x8 numbered copies
[06/11 01:31] <dsk_hbe> none of those are bridge copies
[06/11 01:32] <dsk_hbe> then you can do the same check for LSRREQPRODCL02XA, LSRREQPRODCL03XB, AND LSRREQPRODCL04XA
[06/11 01:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Basically just verify there are no bridge copies connected in any of the 4 clusters
[06/11 01:34] <dsk_hbe> any of the 4 clusters' sysplex... right... this is the entity that is used for PULL logic and if we had bridge copies connected, we would be risking live users hitting our release code before we are ready for them to
[06/11 01:35] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[06/11 01:35] <dsk_hbe> the reality is that we have been running our bridging in PUSH mode for ages, but this is extra protection
[06/11 01:35] <dsk_hbe> and we sure don't want to unplumb this in case we decide to change that any time soon.
[06/11 01:35] <06Amit_ZOS> checking in CL2
[06/11 01:35] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/11 01:37] <06Amit_ZOS> x2,x3,x7 & x8 for SR's
[06/11 01:37] <dsk_hbe> yep
[06/11 01:37] <06Amit_ZOS> FDP9* for LFD's
[06/11 01:38] <06Amit_ZOS> FDP80 and 89g present
[06/11 01:40] <06Amit_ZOS> All 4 Cl's look good
[06/11 01:40] <dsk_hbe> cool... you didn't say it, but you shoudl also have seen the LSAs connected
[06/11 01:41] <06Amit_ZOS> yes,, SAP01's were there
[06/11 01:42] <06Amit_ZOS> SAP03 and SAP06 too
[06/11 01:42] <dsk_hbe> and of course what is most important is to know that no bridge copies are there, so basically you need to know what are and are not bridge copies
[06/11 01:43] <06Amit_ZOS> except SAP05's is that a bridge copy?
[06/11 01:43] <dsk_hbe> only sap1,3,4,6 are not bridge copies.
[06/11 01:45] <dsk_hbe> sap2 and 5 were set up as bridge copies, kinda... their job is to allow us to keep promotes functional longer than we used to... the shortened promote window that Jim worked on last year... big savings for the fabrication people
[06/11 01:45] <06Amit_ZOS> cool..
[06/11 01:45] <dsk_hbe> so you shoudl have seen 1,3,4,6 in that list of 20
[06/11 01:47] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/11 01:48] <06Amit_ZOS> is it time for us to ask OPS to let us know after crit is run?
[06/11 01:48] <dsk_hbe> ok, I'm going to do the change control thing now... yay
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL01.DIARIES
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL02.DIARIES
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL03.DIARIES
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL04.DIARIES
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL08.DIARIES
[06/11 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL09.DIARIES
[06/11 02:17] <dsk_hbe> remember, we don't have any LFDs up yet, so anything you find in those LFD diaries will not be release related yet
[06/11 02:17] <06Amit_ZOS> oh yeah
[06/11 02:32] <06Amit_ZOS> are we ready to run lcreadd??
[06/11 02:32] <06Amit_ZOS> for lcre diaries
[06/11 02:32] <06Amit_ZOS> SR diaries look good untill now
[06/11 02:32] <06Amit_ZOS> i haven't cross verified the version mods though
[06/11 02:34] <dsk_hbe> they will likely not want to check those until after they've done some testing.  However, thre were no LCRE code changes so they may only half-heartedly check them.  It might be more up to us to verify nothign bad is going on.  Let's sub them for the devs along with when they request MVS diaries.  Meantime, please feel free to check them as often as you like!!
[06/11 02:38] <06Amit_ZOS> so we'l just submit the SR diaries for now you mean
[06/11 02:40] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX.PROD1.NOW.DIARY.LCRE.D170611.CTL
[06/11 02:40] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX.PROD1.NOW.DRY.LCRE.D170611.T023941
[06/11 02:41] <dsk_hbe> share that last dataset with them
[06/11 02:41] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX.PROD1.NOW.DRY.LCRE.D170611.T023941
[06/11 02:41] <dsk_hbe> they don't care about the CTL guy
[06/11 02:41] <dsk_hbe> on #zos-release
[06/11 02:41] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. srry
[06/11 02:42] <dsk_hbe> hahaha
[06/11 02:42] <06Amit_ZOS> forgot ctrl+tab doesn't work on channel window swaps
[06/11 02:42] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[06/11 02:43] <06Amit_ZOS> actually ctrl+tab works
[06/11 02:43] <06Amit_ZOS> alt+tab doesnt
[06/11 03:06] <dsk_hbe> see that, AMit?
[06/11 03:07] <06Amit_ZOS> saw
[06/11 03:07] <dsk_hbe> ok, now, be sure not to sub anymore of those.  After I do the next step, if you sub more, it will hose the LCRE EOD for prod
[06/11 03:08] <dsk_hbe> also, since the devs don't care too mcuh about LCRE, will you gve that diary a good lookover?
[06/11 03:08] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. will not do anymore lcreadd
[06/11 03:11] <06Amit_ZOS> no issues there
[06/11 03:13] <dsk_hbe> thanks for checkign those, AMit... you handling LCRE was a big help to me!
[06/11 03:14] <06Amit_ZOS> you'r welcome Debbie! But you'r the surgeon! I merely hand you some tools! :P
[06/11 03:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Are we done debbie!>
[06/11 03:15] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[06/11 03:15] <dsk_hbe> I didn't touch lcre though... you were it's doctor ;-)
[06/11 03:15] <dsk_hbe> we are done!  just some paperwork left for me
[06/11 03:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome!
[06/11 03:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Have a good night/morning Debbie!
[06/11 03:16] <dsk_hbe> thanks, you too!!

[06/12 11:35] <02charlie> fortunately, the bike only needs a wheel, looks like that's it, under $100 to fix it
[06/12 11:35] <02charlie> no, not until 1240
[06/12 11:36] <dsk_hbe> if not, I will let you keep it... I got some more info on what I need to do for Vickie's report and need to get that done today.  I really wish she'd just give me complete specs to start with ;-)
[06/12 11:36] <02charlie> sure, i'll keep it, np
[06/12 11:36] <dsk_hbe> I don't think you need to carry your laptop anywehere... AMit has primary and I am sittign right here if he needs me.  In case I am buried in Vickie's job, Amit, be sure to say my name so it gets my attention

[06/12 11:37] <02charlie> sure amit
[06/12 11:38] <02charlie> tools, options
[06/12 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> I have added an option
[06/12 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> can someone say my name pls
[06/12 11:40] <02charlie> amit
[06/12 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> nope
[06/12 11:40] <02charlie> amit_zos
[06/12 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> that didn't wor
[06/12 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> work
[06/12 11:41] <02charlie> i'm trying to figure it out, so give me a minute
[06/12 11:41] <02charlie> i also have merlin runnng saying things, so my setup is a bit different from the rest
[06/12 11:42] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/12 11:42] <dsk_hbe> I use tools;option;IRC;highlight... it doesn't say my name but it makes irc flash in my tray
[06/12 11:43] <dsk_hbe> I also have it flash for warmstart and ss-mvs
[06/12 11:44] <06Amit_zOS> Yes, it flashes for mine too for any messages that pops up in the channels im in
[06/12 11:45] <dsk_hbe> way too much flashing for me ;-)  I let it ding at me and sometimes that is too much ;-)
[06/12 11:45] <02charlie> tools;options;IRC;options;Flash on message and tools;options;sounds;enable sounds
[06/12 11:45] <dsk_hbe> Charlie is the other extreme... his world is very noisy ;-)
[06/12 11:46] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[06/12 11:46] <02charlie> but i only have it make the dings if it's my name (charlie) or MvS or warmstart
[06/12 11:46] <06Amit_zOS> I think its making a beep for every message now
[06/12 11:47] <02charlie> well, i only have flas on message for query and chat
[06/12 11:47] <06Amit_zOS> now can someone say my name?
[06/12 11:47] <02charlie> not for channel
[06/12 11:47] <02charlie> amit
[06/12 11:47] <02charlie> amit_zos
[06/12 11:48] <06Amit_zOS> nope
[06/12 11:48] <02charlie> does it flash?
[06/12 11:49] <02charlie> oh, wait, let me check address book
[06/12 11:50] <02charlie> ah, tools, address book, highlight
[06/12 11:50] <06Amit_zOS> It does flash
[06/12 11:50] <02charlie> all the time or just when i say your name, amit?
[06/12 11:51] <06Amit_zOS> All the time Im not looking and there is a message in the channel
[06/12 11:52] <02charlie> your "flash on message" setting probably has all three boxes checked (channel, query, chat)
[06/12 11:53] <06Amit_zOS> Flash on has only two boxes for me
[06/12 11:53] <06Amit_zOS> channel and query
[06/12 11:53] <02charlie> when i go into tools, address book, highlight, i can control what will happen when i want something highlighted
[06/12 11:53] <02charlie> then uncheck channel
[06/12 11:53] <02charlie> it will stop flashing for every message in the channel
[06/12 11:54] <06Amit_zOS> hmm.. but that's not what I was shooting at.. 
[06/12 11:54] <06Amit_zOS> I just wanted a beep when my name pops up in the messages
[06/12 11:54] <02charlie> go into tools, address book, highlight
[06/12 11:55] <02charlie> that's where my version has the control for that
[06/12 11:56] <02charlie> you have to have sounds enabled under tools, options, sounds
[06/12 11:56] <02charlie> and you have to enable highlight under tools, address book, highlight
[06/12 11:56] <02charlie> and you have to add the term you want (amit) to the highlight list
[06/12 11:57] <06Amit_zOS> I do have it there
[06/12 11:58] <06Amit_zOS> and all you said above is done
[06/12 11:58] <06Amit_zOS> just not getting the beep when Amit or amit is said
[06/12 11:58] <02charlie> hmm, close & restart mirc

[06/12 11:59] <02charlie> amit, does that help?
[06/12 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> nope :(
[06/12 11:59] <02charlie> ok, i'll lync you
[06/12 12:00] <06Amit_ZOS> checking amit
[06/12 12:03] <02charlie> Amit_ZOS, how is that?

[06/12 12:05] <02charlie> amit
[06/12 12:05] <06Amit_ZOS> :(
[06/12 12:08] <02charlie> sorry, i'm looking to see where my cound files are
[06/12 12:08] <02charlie> sound
[06/12 12:08] <02charlie> it may be you just dont have the beep sound
[06/12 12:08] <06Amit_ZOS> I get the beeps for connect and disconnect
[06/12 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> so, the sounds actually there
[06/12 12:09] <02charlie> hmm, ok
[06/12 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway charlie, i think i can sort this out later
[06/12 12:09] <02charlie> ok, sorry
[06/12 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks though
[06/12 12:10] <06Amit_ZOS> i will figure it out.. no probs
[06/12 12:10] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/12 12:11] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[06/12 12:11] <06Amit_ZOS> coffee
[06/12 12:11] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/12 12:21] <02charlie> debbie, quick question
[06/12 12:21] <dsk_hbe> yes?
[06/12 12:21] <02charlie> INC01559372,  05:10:03 PCS03 DPPINX DPPGATEWAYERR: CHECK FOR SAVED RESEARCH FAILED.    
[06/12 12:21] <02charlie> am i correct this is due to some internal user, and we can ignore it?
[06/12 12:22] <02charlie> the PCS manual seems to indicate so (it was not possible to contact the SA to retrieve any saved research)
[06/12 12:22] <dsk_hbe> definitely... no billables on PCS.  
[06/12 12:22] <02charlie> well, not ignore, but close it :)
[06/12 12:23] <dsk_hbe> I agree :-)
[06/12 12:23] <02charlie> thx
[06/12 12:23] <02charlie> triveni, since you're looking at it, you can do the honors
[06/12 12:23] <02charlie> :)
[06/12 12:24] <triveni> ok
[06/12 12:24] <02charlie> and i also suspect it is connected with eclipse, and i correct?
[06/12 12:24] <triveni> you have already updated the ticket with ur comments
[06/12 12:25] <triveni> so i just have to close it
[06/12 12:25] <dsk_hbe> the dpp thing?  No, likely not
[06/12 12:25] <dsk_hbe> but I didn't look at it.
[06/12 12:25] <02charlie> oh, ok
[06/12 12:26] <triveni> am trying to understand though..what happened..
[06/12 12:26] <triveni> the user was trying to load its saved search?
[06/12 12:27] <triveni> and it failed.. it seems.. so the ticket..
[06/12 12:28] <dsk_hbe> let's look a second... I checked the diary and if you look ahead of it you see it gves more info:
[06/12 12:28] <dsk_hbe> P003GA051003GWMGR  GWRSR: NO LSA AVAILABLE,      ,R01 RC=03
[06/12 12:28] <dsk_hbe> P003GA051003GWMGR  GWRSR,H1T8KQ,
[06/12 12:28] <dsk_hbe> P003DP051003DPPINX DPP_GATEWAY_ERR: CHECK FOR SAVED RESEARCH FAILED.
[06/12 12:29] <dsk_hbe> so we have a userID.
[06/12 12:29] <dsk_hbe> H1T8KQ is one of our Manila folks
[06/12 12:29] <02charlie> hmm, i thought PCS only dealt with printing, i guess it's more than that. it must store the history for the classic sessions
[06/12 12:30] <dsk_hbe> like Charlie said... temporary issue talkign to LSA... happens often... not daily... but often.
[06/12 12:30] <triveni> PCs comes into picture only for classic searches?
[06/12 12:31] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I have a job set up where we can run real time user reports for Classic... ukambds.ispf.jcllib(online1).  It goes against all of the monitors the LSA uses.  Just edit the two palces that have my ID - 815hk3, to use this ID H1T8KQ
[06/12 12:31] <triveni> yes debbie..u shared it once with me..
[06/12 12:31] <dsk_hbe> I ran one - JOB(UKAMBDSU,204803)
[06/12 12:31] <02charlie> just got a call from the bike shop, the patient is no longer sick :)
[06/12 12:31] <triveni> i have vague memories..but yes you did..
[06/12 12:32] <dsk_hbe> so in there if oyu go down to the time of the PCS error - you'll see that the user has timed out his LSA session... so in this case, that is the root cause... he walked away from a live session... if he doesn't do any work for 15 minutes, LSA will time out.
[06/12 12:32] <triveni> ok..
[06/12 12:33] <dsk_hbe> if you run a lsa diary, you likely will see that ID issuing a timout message as well
[06/12 12:34] <triveni> ok..
[06/12 12:34] <dsk_hbe> or not... I don't see one... weird..
[06/12 12:35] <triveni> m looking at ur job in iof
[06/12 12:35] <dsk_hbe> ah yeah, there it is:
[06/12 12:35] <dsk_hbe> * 050601 0150 T/P READ TIMEOUT - @@@@-02FD-P111VG9H1T8KQ -046-000000
[06/12 12:35] <triveni> i couldn't find pcs eror
[06/12 12:35] <dsk_hbe> which job are you looking at... the one I just pasted was the user report, not the pcs diary
[06/12 12:36] <dsk_hbe> here is the pcs diary - 200627 UKAMBDSX
[06/12 12:36] <triveni> ok
[06/12 12:36] <dsk_hbe> you can run a PCS diary with this command - 'g9.runolm all'... or int his case since you know it was out of PCS3, 'g9.runolm 3'
[06/12 12:36] <dsk_hbe> all that is a bunch of information you likely will enver use ;-)
[06/12 12:37] <02charlie> ok, wife is gettying antsy, so i guess we'd better leave
[06/12 12:37] <triveni> charlie.. 
[06/12 12:37] <02charlie> yes?
[06/12 12:37] <triveni> m closing the ticket with
[06/12 12:37] <triveni> application software
[06/12 12:37] <triveni> mainframe
[06/12 12:38] <triveni> procedural error
[06/12 12:38] <triveni> is dat ok?
[06/12 12:38] <triveni> in resolve information.
[06/12 12:38] <02charlie> appl server
[06/12 12:39] <triveni> dis snow is so dumb.. i haven't saved it.. but its not letting me change the category..
[06/12 12:39] <02charlie> apl server, other, procedural error
[06/12 12:39] <02charlie> have to leave the page completely
[06/12 12:40] <02charlie> ok, l8r
[06/12 12:40] <triveni> got it
[06/12 12:40] <triveni> thanks
[06/12 12:41] <triveni> Resolved..
[06/12 12:42] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/12 12:42] <triveni> debbie..
[06/12 12:43] <dsk_hbe> yes ma'am?
[06/12 12:43] <triveni> u tried to fidn out the timeframe in pcs diary
[06/12 12:43] <dsk_hbe> in teh user report.
[06/12 12:43] <dsk_hbe> the PCS errors message was this:
[06/12 12:44] <dsk_hbe> P003DP051003DPPINX DPP_GATEWAY_ERR: CHECK FOR SAVED RESEARCH FAILED.
[06/12 12:44] <triveni> ok
[06/12 12:44] <dsk_hbe> the time in there is the 051003 part.
[06/12 12:44] <dsk_hbe> so I then went to the user report and looked around that time
[06/12 12:45] <triveni> ok
[06/12 12:45] <dsk_hbe> did you find it okay?
[06/12 12:46] <dsk_hbe> to fully understand that user report you have to know a lot more information that really truly is a waste fo your time .  But I will tell you that when you see a '045' msg number like this:
[06/12 12:46] <dsk_hbe> 1 02FD H1T8KQ 170612 050539 050539 045 0000 000000
[06/12 12:46] <dsk_hbe> that means the user's session timed out
[06/12 12:46] <triveni> ohh
[06/12 12:47] <triveni> i found out the line DPP_GATEWAY_ERR
[06/12 12:47] <triveni> am trying to understand it
[06/12 12:48] <dsk_hbe> if we had billables still on classic we'd spend a lot more time teachign you guys this kind of stuff, but for now we will just have to tell you bits and pieces as applicable to the investigation at hand... it surprises me, honestly, that OPS even put a ticket in for this.  They pretty much ignore classic PCS and LSA as well these days, as well they should!
[06/12 12:48] <dsk_hbe> what more can I tell you to understand it... let me lay out the first part: P003DP051003DPPINX
[06/12 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> So, if i may try to summarize, In the ticket, i saw PCS03 which lead me to believe that this is a classic user which means not billable which means internal and hence No stress!?
[06/12 12:48] <dsk_hbe> P003= the Prod PCS copy number 3
[06/12 12:49] <dsk_hbe> yes AMit!!!
[06/12 12:49] <dsk_hbe> the DP = the PCS DPP product issued the message
[06/12 12:49] <dsk_hbe> 051003 = 05:10:03
[06/12 12:49] <triveni> ok debbie..now i understood.. i checked the usr rprt foudn the '045' 
[06/12 12:49] <dsk_hbe> DPPINX = the module in the DPP product that issued the message
[06/12 12:50] <dsk_hbe> great!
[06/12 12:50] <triveni> thanks debbie..
[06/12 12:50] <dsk_hbe> sure!!
[06/12 12:50] <triveni> I ll just try to remember the steps..
[06/12 12:50] <triveni> coz we are still getting tickets.. 
[06/12 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> Anything important in today's releas committee meeting debbie?
[06/12 12:51] <dsk_hbe> if you ever get one higher than a priority 3, we'll have to talk to someone abotu it ;-)
[06/12 12:51] <triveni> ok debbie..
[06/12 12:51] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... do you mean Steve Hankins performance team meeting?
[06/12 12:52] <06Amit_zOS> no, the one thats about to start
[06/12 12:52] <06Amit_zOS> at 1pm
[06/12 12:52] <06Amit_zOS> I think usually Loman leads the meeting
[06/12 12:52] <dsk_hbe> Oh, I never attend those anymore
[06/12 12:52] <06Amit_zOS> Cool.. glad to know
[06/12 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> cz we'r a regular at Steve's meetings!
[06/12 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> it much more interesting..
[06/12 12:53] <dsk_hbe> I don't think Charlie or Jim do either... we used to ages ago, back when they talked mostly abotu our releases, but now it's a lot about UNix, etc. releases and very little about ours.
[06/12 12:54] <06Amit_zOS> and not just because you can see people's reaction while Triveni dozes off... the content is good too!
[06/12 12:54] <dsk_hbe> LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[06/12 12:56] <dsk_hbe> ok, I need to bury my nose abck in Vickie's report.  Say my name if you need me!
[06/12 12:58] <06Amit_zOS> will do
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS> Found the exact piece of code that determines the jnorm score for FG/BG routing:
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>  searchLimit = searchLimit + (counters.formsSearchTerms * numDb * BACKGROUND_FORMS_SCALE +
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>                        counters.subsegSearchTerms * numDb * BACKGROUND_SUBSEGS_SCALE +
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>                        (counters.wordsWithLeadingSuperUniv +
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>                         counters.wordsWithEmbeddedSuperUniv +
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>                         counters.wordsWithSuperUnivEnding) * numDb * BACKGROUND_SUPER_U_SCALE +
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>                        counters.singleSuperUniv * numDb * BACKGROUND_SINGLE_SUPER_U_SCALE);
[06/12 13:05] <06Amit_zOS>         
[06/12 13:10] <dsk_hbe> I jus knew you'd love digging into some real code ;-)
[06/12 13:12] <06Amit_zOS> And It looks like Java to me.. Clearcase is a language?
[06/12 13:13] <dsk_hbe> it's Java... clearcase is the repository for the code I believe.  I don't know anything about hwo to even use it so can't say that 100%
[06/12 13:13] <dsk_hbe> it is not something that was ever shared with us... maybe some day we need to have them show us around
[06/12 13:13] <06Amit_zOS> googled it.. its an asset management system
[06/12 13:13] <dsk_hbe> so in this case, asset= code
[06/12 13:14] <dsk_hbe> ok, back to my code... this stuff is majorly confusing
[06/12 13:14] <06Amit_zOS> anyway, i just was curious, what constitutes the score.. I now know that it depends on those above variables
[06/12 13:14] <dsk_hbe> yep
[06/12 13:14] <dsk_hbe> picture's worth a thousand words
[06/12 13:15] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks a lot debbie for this:)
[06/12 13:16] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/12 14:32] <02charlie> back

[06/13 10:02] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/13 10:05] <02charlie> in what context? sounds familiar, but i'm drawing a blank
[06/13 10:06] <dsk_hbe> he means the freestyle type searching
[06/13 10:06] <02charlie> ah, doh!
[06/13 10:06] <dsk_hbe> yet another thing we have to have multiple names for - AR = Assocated Retrieval
[06/13 10:06] <06Amit_zOS> from the prod abends yesterday
[06/13 10:07] <02charlie> my brain is stuck in what i'm currently working on
[06/13 10:07] <06Amit_zOS> sorry to distract
[06/13 10:08] <06Amit_zOS> i just noticed, that a search with misplaced double quotes causing a lot of problems like these..
[06/13 10:16] <dsk_hbe> I can give you a kinda brief description of what freestyle/AR means, Amit... instead of using connecters like A or B and C, freestyle allows you to enter normal search text like 'where did Amit go to college' for a search.
[06/13 10:17] <dsk_hbe> sometimes users don't knwo what they are doing and still enter connectors though ;-)
[06/13 10:18] <06Amit_zOS> I knew what freestyle searches are.. is that the same as AR?
[06/13 10:18] <dsk_hbe> basically yes
[06/13 10:18] <06Amit_zOS> cool..
[06/13 10:19] <06Amit_zOS> so are keywords like "OR" or "w\25" allowed within these freestyle searches?
[06/13 10:20] <dsk_hbe> I can't say for sure but I'd guss it had some issues with w/25 which is not normal text in a sentence.  Since Charlie has been looking at these he may have to say for sure.
[06/13 10:20] <dsk_hbe> ors and ands are certainly normal words
[06/13 10:20] <02charlie> sorry, i've at least sent me note off
[06/13 10:21] <06Amit_zOS> I see..
[06/13 10:21] <02charlie> which abend are you looking at
[06/13 10:21] <06Amit_zOS> SNMSGD+100E
[06/13 10:21] <06Amit_zOS> the mail from Vickie
[06/13 10:22] <02charlie> oh, that's KPMG
[06/13 10:22] <06Amit_zOS> oh sorry, you were not cc'd there
[06/13 10:22] <dsk_hbe> he shoudl have been
[06/13 10:22] <02charlie> i thought  i was
[06/13 10:22] <dsk_hbe> he replied to them
[06/13 10:22] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/13 10:22] <06Amit_zOS> srry
[06/13 10:22] <06Amit_zOS> you were
[06/13 10:46] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, since I will be on vacation next week and can't help with daytime backup, woudl you be okay if I take it during my hours the rest of thsi week?  
[06/13 10:46] <02charlie> sure
[06/13 10:47] <02charlie> just throw me back in when you leave
[06/13 10:47] <dsk_hbe> will do... if I ever get there to put me in!
[06/13 10:47] <02charlie> lol
[06/13 10:47] <02charlie> bwhahahahaha :D
[06/13 10:47] <dsk_hbe> finally!
[06/13 10:48] <06Amit_zOS> :)
[06/13 10:54] * JimE_zOS has joined #theRock
[06/13 10:54] * ChanServ sets mode: +qo JimE_zOS JimE_zOS

[06/13 11:01] <dsk_hbe> hiya, Jim
[06/13 11:02] <JimE_zOS> quiet night for me, BTW 
[06/13 11:02] <JimE_zOS> which is kinda disappointing because Martha decided that allowed me to do some yard work. 
[06/13 11:04] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee.  BRB 
[06/13 11:05] <06Amit_zOS> cool..

[06/13 11:22] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/13 11:46] <triveni> I have connected from home.. I will be in office after lunch..
[06/13 11:48] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/13 11:55] <dsk_hbe> ls law360 the same as lexis360??
[06/13 11:56] <02charlie> no
[06/13 11:56] <02charlie> law360 is a news thingy
[06/13 11:56] <02charlie> lexis360 is a FR and AR (? Austria) product
[06/13 11:56] <dsk_hbe> ah ok... such similar names we use around here... glad someone can keep them straight
[06/13 11:56] <JimE_zOS> hence the cleaver name "law" :-)
[06/13 11:57] <02charlie> lol
[06/13 11:57] <dsk_hbe> hehehehe
[06/13 11:57] <JimE_zOS> I'm just a hick farmer.  What would I know about anything? 
[06/13 11:57] <02charlie> :D
[06/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> I bet my weekend and Mike W's weekend looking nothing a like. 
[06/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> looked, even. 
[06/13 11:58] <06Amit_zOS> yes, its austria
[06/13 11:58] <02charlie> like one of those ignorant country lawyers...they'll clean your clock with one hand tied behind their backs :)
[06/13 11:59] <02charlie> i was uncerain of the country code for austria
[06/13 11:59] <02charlie> isnt that where they have all those kangaroos? :D
[06/13 11:59] <triveni> that's austrailia..
[06/13 12:00] <triveni> well..austria as well z known for that..
[06/13 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> AU is australia
[06/13 12:01] <JimE_zOS> Austria...home of Mozart.  
[06/13 12:01] <JimE_zOS> technically, home of Hitler too.  
[06/13 12:01] <02charlie> yes
[06/13 12:01] <JimE_zOS> one of the reasons he annexed Austria so early in his rise to power. 
[06/13 12:02] <JimE_zOS> that and to destroy some birth records which suggested that he had some Jewish family members. 
[06/13 12:03] <JimE_zOS> I have pictures from the weekend, but they are all 2M+ and I don't want to melt the network. 
[06/13 12:04] <02charlie> melt away :D
[06/13 12:04] <triveni> I have always been fascinated with world war and hitler stories..
[06/13 12:04] <triveni> dey are so interesting..
[06/13 12:04] <dsk_hbe> I forget what you were up to over the weekend Jim?
[06/13 12:05] <JimE_zOS> awful and interesting at the same time, yes, agree. 
[06/13 12:05] <triveni> ;))
[06/13 12:05] <JimE_zOS> pictures will shed likght, Debbie. 
[06/13 12:05] <JimE_zOS> there are so many things about WWII that I don't understand. 
[06/13 12:05] <triveni> that's the beauty of it..
[06/13 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> maybe we can have a session on that?
[06/13 12:06] <JimE_zOS> and so many things that are still classified and secret
[06/13 12:06] <triveni> yeah 
[06/13 12:06] <triveni> d documentaries are fun to watch..
[06/13 12:07] <JimE_zOS> like the details of Himmler's death while in the custody of the British.  Those details are classified until 2045, I belive. 
[06/13 12:07] <triveni> yeah..
[06/13 12:07] <JimE_zOS> what about that can require hidding for that long? 
[06/13 12:07] <triveni> I loved the movie Schindler's list. It showed a different side..
[06/13 12:08] <dsk_hbe> ah, lumberjack work!  Wow, you must be sore from head to toe
[06/13 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> Secret society Jim... you of all people should understand!
[06/13 12:08] <triveni> cool pictures JIm..
[06/13 12:08] <JimE_zOS> yes, lumber jack......
[06/13 12:09] <JimE_zOS> we rented a lift so we could go up and cut the tree down in little pieces.  Too close to the house to risk just dropping them. 
[06/13 12:09] <triveni> Did u use an axe by urself.. to cut it..
[06/13 12:09] <JimE_zOS> the one we did cut from the ground was done only after we have taken all of hte house side weight off of it. 
[06/13 12:09] <JimE_zOS> chain saw
[06/13 12:09] <triveni> chain saw..hmm.. interesting..
[06/13 12:10] <triveni> it would have been fast then..
[06/13 12:10] <JimE_zOS> harness and lift.  We (my son and I) were up about 50 feet in the air. 
[06/13 12:10] <JimE_zOS> not so.  
[06/13 12:10] <JimE_zOS> about 1.5 days to do that. 
[06/13 12:10] <triveni> ohh..
[06/13 12:11] <JimE_zOS> and I still have to clean it all up. 
[06/13 12:11] <JimE_zOS> a did some brush dragging this morning, in fact. 
[06/13 12:11] <triveni> YOu had a fun weekend ;))
[06/13 12:11] <06Amit_zOS> As always!
[06/13 12:11] <JimE_zOS> nothing at all like Mike Walsh's weekend.
[06/13 12:12] <JimE_zOS> nice to work a project with William.  
[06/13 12:12] <JimE_zOS> that is always good even when the project is hard. 
[06/13 12:12] <02charlie> ayep
[06/13 12:14] <JimE_zOS> eventually, the mess will be gone and I'll rent a stump grinder to remove all traces of the trees. 
[06/13 12:25] <02charlie> terminex finally left, they still have to come back to finish

[06/13 12:41] <02charlie> why would you be searching for "No Record Found : Searches done as per the information provided on KCheck. "?
[06/13 12:41] <02charlie> unless that was fed in from some automated process?
[06/13 12:43] <dsk_hbe> no idea...  I just can't get to automated with that line myself.  you could be right, just no idea... what product is this?
[06/13 12:43] <02charlie> dunno. i think its diligence or diligence related
[06/13 12:43] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I don't think he says it clearly, but I think Jack is asking for a FABC diary checkout
[06/13 12:44] <02charlie> kpmg is the user
[06/13 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> oh cool
[06/13 12:44] <dsk_hbe> are you pulling that from smapi, Charlie?  if so there are columns that say the product number
[06/13 12:44] <02charlie> yeah, he's supposed to page, but he never does 
[06/13 12:44] <dsk_hbe> Jack is untrainable
[06/13 12:44] <02charlie> ah
[06/13 12:45] <02charlie> 108
[06/13 12:45] <02charlie> yrmv1
[06/13 12:46] <dsk_hbe> 108 is the product?  hmmm... never heard of that
[06/13 12:46] <02charlie> oh, you mean prdctcd
[06/13 12:46] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[06/13 12:47] <02charlie> sec
[06/13 12:47] <02charlie> im still trying to absorb all the info smapi gives me, and its been more than two years now
[06/13 12:48] <02charlie> 8
[06/13 12:48] <02charlie> is the product code
[06/13 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> im checking diaries now
[06/13 12:48] <dsk_hbe> that's LDC
[06/13 12:49] <dsk_hbe> dunno... just weird... kinda feels like they pulled up some junk from a screen scrape
[06/13 12:49] <dsk_hbe> I hear ya, Charlie, I forget some info is in there sometimes.
[06/13 12:50] <02charlie> which is what makes me think it's automated. i dont think a human would do that unless they dont read english
[06/13 12:50] <dsk_hbe> especially since thsi is listed as an easy search (yet another name for freestyle, Amit ;-)
[06/13 12:50] <dsk_hbe> I am thinking bad screen scrape... which is why I say the above.
[06/13 12:51] <dsk_hbe> unless you find a ton of searches with that same 'text' I'd vote bad screen scrape
[06/13 12:52] <dsk_hbe> smapi doesn't let you search via text string but the RAP report does
[06/13 12:52] <02charlie> i'll check later. right now i'm doing a bunch of smapi searches to compose the note i'm working on
[06/13 12:52] <02charlie> *No record* in vchinfo does
[06/13 12:53] <dsk_hbe> oh sure, good point... see... I forget how powerful smapi is and I just talked abotu hwo you coudl wildcard things last week ;-)
[06/13 12:54] <02charlie> i had forgotten too, but then the memory of you telling me came back while i was in the middle of my searches. much more fruitful searching nw :)
[06/13 12:54] <02charlie> i learned i can wildcard the webids too
[06/13 12:55] <02charlie> because for some of the records, it's the full webid, and others its truncated
[06/13 12:55] <dsk_hbe> yeah you can wildcard almost any field
[06/13 12:56] <dsk_hbe> and be sure to remember that for zlfd because for some reason jnorm lists a chkdig when the other pieces don't :-/
[06/13 12:56] <dsk_hbe> I even taught Anita that... it was a good day ;-)  since she is usually the one teaching me ;-)
[06/13 12:57] <triveni> what parameters we have given in smapi for that user
[06/13 12:58] <02charlie> if this is what youre asking:
[06/13 12:59] <02charlie> Key Event Records for qsrchserver

[06/13 12:59] <triveni> yeah i was asking that..
[06/13 12:59] <triveni> i ll try tht now.
[06/13 13:05] <dsk_hbe> ya know, it is kinda a bummer to know that they install a UNIX release and test it on FABC before FABC has the new MVS release code (happens this coming weekend.)  I hope that doesn't cause Jim heartache come UNIX release checkout Thursday night.  Good thing it was a smallish MVS release.
[06/13 13:06] <02charlie> yeah, that was the reason i re-did my IRS Manual search in prod, once in FF ad then again in IE
[06/13 13:07] <02charlie> i dont normally do any searchig in prod, but since it didnt blow up fabc, i wanted to ensure it wasnt release-related behavior
[06/13 13:22] <02charlie> ever done a trace by session debbie, seems to be taking a long time
[06/13 13:22] <dsk_hbe> I have and it does!  It's lookign at a lot of data

[06/13 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> so assuming not an issue and i see bad fgDART highest(6+ seconds) which is again normal for FABC
[06/13 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> checked SR and LFD diaries and didnt find anything out of the ordinary. (Compared the ablines with production ablines too)
[06/13 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> 2)Checked for zlfdbridje and J* for MAJ error records for today between 9 am to 12:15pm and it did'nt throw anything
[06/13 13:30] <02charlie> did you check the lcre diaries for fabc?
[06/13 13:31] <06Amit_zOS> thats the only thing i havent done
[06/13 13:31] <dsk_hbe> all the rest sounds good to me, Amit.  They don't touch LSA so good to ignore those
[06/13 13:32] <06Amit_zOS> just submitted that

[06/13 13:38] <dsk_hbe> back
[06/13 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> copies 10 and 15 had SCTDCT
[06/13 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> and SNCTRL
[06/13 13:39] <02charlie> pretty normal i think
[06/13 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/13 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> so if all is good, i will mail jack once i pick up Triveni
[06/13 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> and come back

[06/13 13:43] <02charlie> hmm, id be concerned about the number and variety of abends in the LCRE

[06/13 13:48] <02charlie> which i assume is a tester
[06/13 13:50] <dsk_hbe> that ID is the same for teh LSR ablines Charlie and I see them in psc1870 qsrch logs so I suspect it's real testing
[06/13 13:50] <02charlie> yes
[06/13 13:50] <dsk_hbe> sure hope they are aware of what they did bad already otherwise they have some splain to do

[06/13 14:03] <06Amit_zOS> hmm, so this should be the result of all the testing they did in fabc right?
[06/13 14:04] <dsk_hbe> what tuids do you have for the lcre issues?  
[06/13 14:04] <dsk_hbe> this is what we have from CL1 - 6C57E1F0-503F-11E7-B46E-CEBCBAE64E01
[06/13 14:04] <dsk_hbe> 64F2E090-503F-11E7-B46E-BD94EC8F5E01
[06/13 14:05] <dsk_hbe> same two fro CL2
[06/13 14:05] <06Amit_zOS> this was the user id for a lot of lcre issues: BPC4HW
[06/13 14:05] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[06/13 14:05] <dsk_hbe> for both LCRE and LSR
[06/13 14:05] <06Amit_zOS> not sure how i can find his tuid
[06/13 14:06] <dsk_hbe> his webID though is MARCOVANGENNIPN9
[06/13 14:06] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[06/13 14:06] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/13 14:06] <dsk_hbe> if you have dumps the tuid will be in those
[06/13 14:06] <dsk_hbe> and I only give you webID because the unix release is mroe of a web-based thing so they can locate who did the research quicker with that
[06/13 14:06] <06Amit_zOS> I see
[06/13 14:07] <dsk_hbe> same two tuids for CL3
[06/13 14:07] <06Amit_zOS> the webid was also from the dumps?
[06/13 14:07] <dsk_hbe> no, I found that via smapi stats... we don't have anythign to do with the webid in MVS... we don't even know what it is
[06/13 14:07] <06Amit_zOS> and these show XXXXX.. so no dump id's there
[06/13 14:08] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/13 14:08] <dsk_hbe> no dumps for LCRE?
[06/13 14:08] <06Amit_zOS> at least for the ones im looking at
[06/13 14:09] <06Amit_zOS> oh just a sec
[06/13 14:09] <dsk_hbe> same two tuids in cl4 as well so when you report to them, you can share those too.  Charlie thinks it is UNix and not us, but we ablined a lot in LSR so I wonder if LSR just didn't like it... still checking some
[06/13 14:09] <06Amit_zOS> found them in the actual diary DUMP.D0613.CPL0.T095132.TH4
[06/13 14:10] <02charlie> well, let me run thos
[06/13 14:11] <06Amit_zOS> well the one i just paste is the one charlie was already talking about
[06/13 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie, could you tell me what and how you are running those
[06/13 14:13] <02charlie> sure, once i make it work :)
[06/13 14:14] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/13 14:15] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I went to L0's dump directory and did this with teh first tuid:
[06/13 14:15] <dsk_hbe> egrep -i 6C57E1F0 *
[06/13 14:15] <dsk_hbe> it is indeed part of many regs dumps
[06/13 14:15] <dsk_hbe> ditto the second tuid
[06/13 14:16] <06Amit_zOS> oh yay, unix...
[06/13 14:16] <dsk_hbe> not a fan?
[06/13 14:16] <06Amit_zOS> not really
[06/13 14:16] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[06/13 14:17] <06Amit_zOS> only cz its sooo confusing to which box to loginto, what id to use and where the heck do i find this file!
[06/13 14:17] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/13 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> do i log into psc1870?
[06/13 14:18] <dsk_hbe> hahaha, that stuff will come in time I guarantee you... sometimes I still have to hover over my keyboadr and think about it ;-)
[06/13 14:18] <dsk_hbe> to get what I just did, you go to the LCRE box that L0 lives on... psc1896
[06/13 14:19] <dsk_hbe> then we keep the dumps in /l-n/work/cre/copy
[06/13 14:19] <dsk_hbe> that's where I did the grep I pasted
[06/13 14:20] <dsk_hbe> so diaries are in /l-n/log/cre/copy... just change the log piece to 'work' for the dumps
[06/13 14:20] <dsk_hbe> all that is hidden from you when oyu run the LCRE tool to get diaries so you cannot be faulted for not having that committed to memory by any means!
[06/13 14:20] <06Amit_zOS> so do i use unenmax or nenminax?
[06/13 14:20] <dsk_hbe> the second one
[06/13 14:20] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/13 14:21] <dsk_hbe> these are Linux boxes.  You only use the U* guy in MVS/USS
[06/13 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> pwd issues
[06/13 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> OLSPROD Unix/NIS domain pwd right?
[06/13 14:28] <02charlie> finally: ULESTCXB J071068
[06/13 14:28] <02charlie> is running
[06/13 14:29] <02charlie> i may have hosed my fabc dataset from last night
[06/13 14:29] <dsk_hbe> I like just doing what I did ;-)
[06/13 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> what did you do?
[06/13 14:30] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I'm looking at the qbrws logs for these transactions... they just issue this kind of thing:
[06/13 14:30] <dsk_hbe> Message: RECOVERABLE ABORT IN LSR
[06/13 14:30] <dsk_hbe> Message Code: information
[06/13 14:30] <dsk_hbe> so the qbrws itself is treated as successful.
[06/13 14:30] <dsk_hbe> AMit, I am talking about the egrep I did.  
[06/13 14:31] <dsk_hbe> I like doing that.  I don't really like the format Charlie's process does, but it works for him and that is all that matters
[06/13 14:31] <06Amit_zOS> oh cool
[06/13 14:33] <dsk_hbe> anyway, here's where I am at with this... I can't say that it's the UNIX release' fault... it coudl be that LCRE is not happy because the LSR processign isn't happy... we sure shodul not be looping.  This is Charlie's area though so I think I shodul leave the rest to him to decide... you good with that Charlie?
[06/13 14:33] <02charlie> yes
[06/13 14:34] <02charlie> ULESTCX.FABC.LCRLIB has the following members, which are the detailed info from the abends
[06/13 14:34] <02charlie> CA170613

[06/13 14:34] <02charlie> M2170613
[06/13 14:34] <02charlie> X8170613
[06/13 14:34] <dsk_hbe> I just sent you guys a summary of what was involved in case you find it useful when you reply to Jack
[06/13 14:34] <02charlie> not happy with the number and variey of abends
[06/13 14:35] <02charlie> the last one is mine, but all the rest are unix release related
[06/13 14:35] <02charlie> i would say they're having a problem
[06/13 14:36] <02charlie> they all seem to have this prodinfo string
[06/13 14:36] <02charlie> <_.cre GLBL.RELEASE="20170518" S.LISTID="ImprvdNewsRslt" 
[06/13 14:37] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, the LASR ablines suggest to me we were looping... different offsets for the code 02 punch depend on where we were int he loop when we punched... so it could be that that makes for a variety fo ablines in LCRE too?
[06/13 14:38] <02charlie> yes, and i also think they're hosing different pieces of different documents, maybe a corewalker that's causing all of these
[06/13 14:38] <dsk_hbe> sounds like a good thing to suspect, Charlie!
[06/13 14:39] <dsk_hbe> maybe there is a stylesheet change tied to this release and they missed it for the FABC testing?
[06/13 14:39] <02charlie> could be
[06/13 14:39] <dsk_hbe> or it's not good ;-)
[06/13 14:40] <dsk_hbe> there's always the chance they are testing something they shoudln't too... big no-no to run destructive testing during release checkout
[06/13 14:40] <dsk_hbe> so many possibilities
[06/13 14:52] <02charlie> are you writing a note to then amit, or do you want me to do so?
[06/13 14:53] <06Amit_zOS> Oh, i haven't starte writing, What exactly should I say, i got the note from debbie but how should i present it?
[06/13 14:53] <06Amit_zOS> I am good at writing "we have no issues and have a good day" but, how do i write that we are having issues????
[06/13 14:54] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if yu shoudl let Charlie write it so he can explain his suspcion abotu teh stylesheet
[06/13 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> That may be good
[06/13 14:55] <02charlie> k
[06/13 14:55] <06Amit_zOS> and also i was wondering if we could have a session about this tomorrow sometime you folks are free..
[06/13 14:56] <triveni> please lemme come back amit..
[06/13 14:56] <dsk_hbe> okbyme, but Charlie and I do a lot of things differently so it may be a free for all ;-)
[06/13 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> who's stopping you from coming back!?
[06/13 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/13 14:56] <dsk_hbe> LOL, I knew what you meant Triveni... he's such a meanie!  ;-) 
[06/13 14:57] <triveni> I am just in my holiday mood.. already there in India.. :))
[06/13 14:58] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[06/13 14:58] <dsk_hbe> Hey Charlie, for grins I looked at some qbrws logs and searched for 'S.LISTID="ImprvdNewsRslt"' and what I am finding always has an older date for this... GLBL.RELEASE="20160915"
[06/13 14:59] <dsk_hbe> prod qbrws logs that is
[06/13 14:59] <02charlie> thx
[06/13 15:17] <dsk_hbe> I am going to call it a day.  Charlie, I put you back in daytime with Amit.  Triveni, have a WONDERFUL trip!!

[06/13 15:18] <triveni> Bye!!
[06/13 15:18] <dsk_away> oh Charlie... just reading tour note... I think those two TUIDs go with all of the LSR ablines.  I woudl be surprised if that wasn't true for LCRE as well.
[06/13 15:18] <dsk_away> bye!
[06/13 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> Bye Debbie!
[06/13 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> have a good day!

[06/14 09:18] * Set by ChanServ on Fri May 12 11:17:17
[06/14 09:18] * ChanServ sets mode: +o Amit_ZOS
[06/14 09:18] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Charlie!
[06/14 09:19] <06Amit_ZOS> Its pouring down like crazy!
[06/14 09:20] <02charlie> good morning amit
[06/14 09:30] <02charlie> im going to head back home from my meeting. I'll be back online in about 20 minutes
[06/14 09:30] * charlie has quit IRC (Quit: )
[06/14 09:34] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[06/14 09:34] <dsk_hbe> morning
[06/14 09:34] <dsk_hbe> I'm in daytime XM
[06/14 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Debbie!
[06/14 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Do we have to SS team meeting today?
[06/14 09:38] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... it's on the calendar, but I can't recall why it was scheduled so early.  We'll have to wait and see when Jim comes in.
[06/14 09:39] <dsk_hbe> the meeting notice says he sent it back on 4/5 so it may be a leftover from room scheduling conflicts 
[06/14 09:40] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah.. I see
[06/14 09:41] <dsk_hbe> yeah, it is a different meeting room than the others.  So, we'll see
[06/14 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> what is PRG?
[06/14 09:57] <dsk_hbe> Pre-Release Group is what I believe it stands for
[06/14 09:58] <dsk_hbe> to the guy who asked if this is maybe they had missing docs in cert last week... I am going to guess yes... looking at teh abline report for spce they have been getting the same LSR ablines for days.  If you recall the LCRE ones, can you go see if those are in that report too?
[06/14 09:58] <dsk_hbe> I see some crecmp ablnes... but can't recall the offsets
[06/14 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> you neab to check in my yesterdays lcre diary?
[06/14 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> *mean
[06/14 10:01] <dsk_hbe> no, remember that online abline report?  This is the URL - http://syswip/ds/Ablines/abline_index.htm
[06/14 10:01] * charlie has joined #theRock
[06/14 10:01] * ChanServ sets mode: +o charlie
[06/14 10:01] <dsk_hbe> choose the SPCE option on that page
[06/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS>  ok
[06/14 10:02] <02charlie> i assume no team meeting today
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> we're assuming that until told otherwise too :-)
[06/14 10:02] <06Amit_ZOS> I can see CRECMP there 
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> Jim's not in yet
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> right... are those the same offsets?
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> Charlie this is what I asked Amit to check:
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> [08:58] <dsk_hbe> to the guy who asked if this is maybe they had missing docs in cert last week... I am going to guess yes... looking at teh abline report for spce they have been getting the same LSR ablines for days.  If you recall the LCRE ones, can you go see if those are in that report too?
[06/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> [08:58] <dsk_hbe> I see some crecmp ablnes... but can't recall the offsets
[06/14 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> 0018A yes
[06/14 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> i can see them
[06/14 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> 0018FE yes
[06/14 10:03] <dsk_hbe> I missed a word in there... but someone just asked about cert testing last week and missing docs in cart... I'm gonna guess the answer is yes... and nice release checkout by them, not
[06/14 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> 0001E yes
[06/14 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> so all yes Debbie!
[06/14 10:03] <02charlie> yes, indeed
[06/14 10:03] <dsk_hbe> thanks Amit.  So they had this in cert last week and waited until this week to make it known to the world :-(
[06/14 10:04] <02charlie> i have fabc but i dont track spce
[06/14 10:04] <dsk_hbe> I'll let you share any of that you like Charlie... I am sooooo going to remain a bystander in that crazy email chain ;-)
[06/14 10:04] <02charlie> :D
[06/14 10:04] <06Amit_ZOS> lol..
[06/14 10:04] <02charlie> i went to the issc meeting this morning
[06/14 10:04] <dsk_hbe> this is where you can point them to cert ablines -  http://syswip/ds/Ablines/abline_index.htm
[06/14 10:05] <dsk_hbe> all those sctdct code 25's and 02's... sigh... and the sccacc that we saw too... and Amit confirmed the LCRE ablines... all there, all week long :-/
[06/14 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> it shows that they had it on 6/12 and not on 6/13
[06/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> the ones we ran yesterday, does that reflect the ones from 6/12?
[06/14 10:06] <dsk_hbe> that's likely becasue they moved their testing to our playground on 6/13 AMit :-/
[06/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> oh
[06/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/14 10:06] <dsk_hbe> what we hit yesterday will be in the FABC section of this report
[06/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> wonderful
[06/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> except apparently we don't have LCRE feeding into that one... 
[06/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> that one being FABC's report
[06/14 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> oh yeah.. never noticed that
[06/14 10:09] <dsk_hbe> they keep asking the question ;-)
[06/14 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> so where is PRG's playground? don't they test stuff in cert?
[06/14 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> or spce?
[06/14 10:10] <dsk_hbe> PRG is specifically set up for the testing they do this week, pre-release connected to FABC before the release is testet/installed against PROD Thursday night
[06/14 10:11] <dsk_hbe> all the testing they did i cert is just via normal cert applciations, CDCs if you are familiar with those?
[06/14 10:11] <dsk_hbe> here's is a kind of picture of cert - it woudl have been teh ones that use SPCE that they used prior to this week - http://www-home/timz/maps/cdc-cs.htm
[06/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> spce is noted under the 'TA MVS Backend' colmn
[06/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> I can't say which CDC they use.  IT deopends on where they have the release code installed
[06/14 10:13] <dsk_hbe> I'd guess the ones called 'Release Cert' but that is only a guess
[06/14 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> not familiar with CDC's although we see them often
[06/14 10:14] <dsk_hbe> try to think of them as individual systems in the same way that PROD, DW, FABC, C1 are separate systems.
[06/14 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[06/14 10:16] <dsk_hbe> Anita is giving them what for ;-)
[06/14 10:17] <02charlie> yeah, which is exactly what they should have been doing before. go, anita, go! :D
[06/14 10:18] <dsk_hbe> so they were just accepting missing docs and going on... sigh
[06/14 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> She is so awesome! Her trainings are also so engaging! Did I tell you we built our very own DBD in yesterdays training session!?
[06/14 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> She can get pretty animated too!
[06/14 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/14 10:19] <dsk_hbe> she is great... all 4 of OUR devs are great... well Don too I guess... he's mroe a trouble-maker ;-)
[06/14 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> lemme guess, Wayne, Joe Simmons, Anita, and Vickie!?
[06/14 10:21] <dsk_hbe> yep, it's so obvious you just knew it ;-)
[06/14 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> :-)
[06/14 10:32] <02charlie> i like to make trouble for don, & vice cersa :)
[06/14 10:34] <dsk_hbe> ditto ;-)

[06/14 10:41] <02charlie> morning jim
[06/14 10:41] <JimE_zOS> nasty drive this morning. 
[06/14 10:42] <JimE_zOS> flooding in spots and lots of standing water on the roadways. 
[06/14 10:44] <dsk_hbe> I hate when this doesn't beep on all irc msgs... hiya, Jim
[06/14 10:44] <dsk_hbe> sorry for your drive :-(
[06/14 10:44] <JimE_zOS> all managable. 
[06/14 10:44] <JimE_zOS> I've certainly driven in worse. 
[06/14 10:45] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I hope your answer is no to a team mtg this morning.  It conflicts with Vickie's mtg for me and I'd like to be there since we just had a release
[06/14 10:47] <JimE_zOS> clearly no. 
[06/14 10:47] <dsk_hbe> thanks!

[06/14 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, will you be doing a session on SOR's?
[06/14 11:32] <dsk_hbe> in a meeting... lets wait for Trveni to be back.  I am also out next week.  
[06/14 11:32] <06Amit_ZOS> Cool
[06/14 11:47] <dsk_hbe> done with meeting.
[06/14 11:47] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I also told you we could talk more about PQS vs. Classic Eclipse.  Are you good with waiting for Triveni to be back for that too?
[06/14 11:48] <06Amit_ZOS> offcourse.. Im good with that
[06/14 11:48] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/14 11:48] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[06/14 11:49] <dsk_hbe> I have a post-it here with a list (also have QDS tool on there - the HCP piece of the web world... not sure I am best to show you that so it will be a brief addition to one of the other items ;_)
[06/14 11:50] <06Amit_ZOS> oops.. the nose fell down.. ;-)
[06/14 11:50] <dsk_hbe> I musta had a sniffing fit... darned allergies ;-)
[06/14 12:01] <06Amit_ZOS> also debbie, didn't you mention VKDQM1 to be a known culprit?
[06/14 12:01] <06Amit_ZOS> is he the KPMG guy?
[06/14 12:02] <dsk_hbe> yep... big pig
[06/14 12:02] <06Amit_ZOS> ok, curious why he's not there in the abuser list
[06/14 12:02] <dsk_hbe> you mean in our fcards?
[06/14 12:02] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/14 12:04] <dsk_hbe> it is more hs browse load that causes issues these days and mostly his BULK retrieval counts.  Right now if we lowered his arrival rate it woudl penalize both his search load (that isn't that bad) and his browse load.  I feel like he's only hurting himself, and part of it is likely the size of the docs he requests, so I don't think adding him to the abuser list will help.
[06/14 12:05] <dsk_hbe> Just in case you don't know, all users are handled throught eh abuser logic.  I need to go find my note on that to remind myself of the defaults... so he is very much already being managed.  You can see that in the abuser report (Wayne's code) that I print out at the end of E88DSK50 daily

[06/14 12:06] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/14 12:08] <dsk_hbe> here we go... thsi might look familiar to you from our training session a while back...
[06/14 12:08] <dsk_hbe> WSK, group 999, hard-coded concurrent limit .95 for all transaction types.
[06/14 12:08] <dsk_hbe> so all of WSK has a pretty healthy abuser limit by default already
[06/14 12:08] <dsk_hbe> that is a hard-coded value
[06/14 12:08] <dsk_hbe> oops, what I pasted said that already... ;-)
[06/14 12:08] <06Amit_ZOS> oh, you could restrict by the bill groups too is it?
[06/14 12:09] <dsk_hbe> no... did I misstype and say bgrp somewhere?
[06/14 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> no.. you just said group
[06/14 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> i extended it in my head
[06/14 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> :"
[06/14 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/14 12:10] <charlie_away> debbie or jim, do you mind if i re-run E99ABURL and replace the STAGEW files out there? 
[06/14 12:10] <dsk_hbe> oh that is the group number given to WSK in the code.  If you look at that abuser report in e88dsk50 you will see that folks like KPMG are listed in the 999 group...w here the IDs we have in the FCards have their wn group numbers
[06/14 12:10] <charlie_away> STAGEW.NE00.LTAED.FABC.ABLINE.DETAIL
[06/14 12:10] <charlie_away> STAGEW.NE00.LTAED.FABC.ABLINE.STATS 
[06/14 12:11] <dsk_hbe> I don't mind Charlie but that process is a tangle so I can't swear to you that tha job is all you have to rerun
[06/14 12:11] <dsk_hbe> assumign you've already dug into that, again, okbyme
[06/14 12:11] <charlie_away> well, i just want to make sure the changes i've made dont break the job
[06/14 12:12] <dsk_hbe> I assumed that... still okbyme.  Jim may know if there is more to it.
[06/14 12:17] <JimE_zOS> I sure don't care either. 
[06/14 12:17] <JimE_zOS> but I'm curious....what did you change that you suspect could have an impact? 
[06/14 12:18] <charlie_away> well, anita noticed there were no LCRE entries in the FABC results from yesterday (and of coursem there were LCRE abends from yesterday)
[06/14 12:19] <charlie_away> so I basically created a merge of the OLS and LCRE diaries just like is done in E#LABURL
[06/14 12:19] <JimE_zOS> I think that is a change Bob made...but it was done some time ago and I don't remember why
[06/14 12:20] <JimE_zOS> the entire flow is Toirac code and I'd be just as happy to toss the entire thing
[06/14 12:21] <dsk_hbe> I do use it, but there are other ways to get the same info.  What I find nice is, like today, being able to go see if cert testing ignored the ablines we had in fabc testing ;-)
[06/14 12:21] <dsk_hbe> that was a quick peek ;-)
[06/14 12:35] <dsk_hbe> not to overshadow the all-important UNIX release, but as far as the MVS release, I don't know of any reason not to okay it for rampdown. Anyone else?
[06/14 12:36] <charlie_away> i see no reason as well
[06/14 12:39] <dsk_hbe> If Jim and Amit are ok, AMit, woudl you like the honors of completing the post-install checklist?  NOrmally it is the oncaller after the release but I doubt Jim woudl mind, Jim?
[06/14 12:55] <06Amit_ZOS> srry, was talking to jim
[06/14 12:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Sure, I can  check, bringing up the checklist
[06/14 12:57] <JimE_zOS> no objection here RE: rampdown
[06/14 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> Ok, so how do I notify ICS that the release is ready for Rampdown?
[06/14 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> who is ICS?
[06/14 13:00] <charlie_away> RD
[06/14 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh ok
[06/14 13:00] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[06/14 13:01] <06Amit_ZOS> So a mail?
[06/14 13:01] <dsk_hbe> first you pull up my copy of the install checklist from our sharepoint... and in there it will tell you the exact email group for RD
[06/14 13:02] <dsk_hbe> and yes, via email
[06/14 13:03] <06Amit_ZOS> GLO-RETS Release Deployment & Joe Simmons
[06/14 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> I also have charlies email from last month
[06/14 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> (last release)
[06/14 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> i can use that
[06/14 13:04] <dsk_hbe> sure
[06/14 13:06] <02charlie> ok, that's my snarky comment
[06/14 13:08] <dsk_hbe> I got three copies, Amit :-)
[06/14 13:08] <dsk_hbe> but that's ok... I have no issue deleting them all ;-)
[06/14 13:08] <02charlie> lol
[06/14 13:09] <06Amit_ZOS> I just copied the to and cc field from charlies and swapped my name with his!
[06/14 13:09] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/14 13:09] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, Charlie, Charlie ;-)
[06/14 13:10] <02charlie> and i have those numbers collected daily :)
[06/14 13:10] <dsk_hbe> I was admonishing your email that Amit copied.
[06/14 13:11] <02charlie> oh
[06/14 13:11] <dsk_hbe> I am very aware of the proliferation of cre messages in our world ;-)
[06/14 13:11] <dsk_hbe> any questions on the next steps, AMit?
[06/14 13:11] <06Amit_ZOS> so up next, SE99FABC$RELEASE  do i need to check if this is scheduled or not?
[06/14 13:12] <dsk_hbe> nah, it will be... but not until Saturday morning
[06/14 13:12] <dsk_hbe> if you are a nervous nelly you could check for it later this week, but I never do.
[06/14 13:12] <dsk_hbe> it is actually scheduled every Saturday... just doesn't always do much
[06/14 13:13] <06Amit_ZOS> Nah, im not nervous when you are around Debbie
[06/14 13:13] <06Amit_ZOS> :
[06/14 13:13] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/14 13:13] <dsk_hbe> oops, thinking of the wrong thing... no, it will be ;-)
[06/14 13:13] <dsk_hbe> I lied again... that is the one... geez... I will stop trying to do 3 things at once until you are done here ;-)
[06/14 13:14] <dsk_hbe> if you are looking at my release doc, you will see that I noted 'no special instructions' for that one, so nothing more to do there
[06/14 13:15] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, that's what was on my head
[06/14 13:15] <dsk_hbe> for the ZAP step, I have those listed for you... have you closed a zap before?
[06/14 13:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Nope. i jave not
[06/14 13:15] <dsk_hbe> ok, I'll list the steps for you.
[06/14 13:15] <dsk_hbe> Go to TSOC
[06/14 13:16] <dsk_hbe> type TSO ZM at any command line
[06/14 13:16] <dsk_hbe> choose 5 -Change Status
[06/14 13:16] <06Amit_ZOS> Panel 'ZMPMAIN0' error
[06/14 13:16] <06Amit_ZOS> Panel definition too large, greater than screen size.
[06/14 13:17] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if TPX limits you.
[06/14 13:17] <06Amit_ZOS> what was that special instruction debbie that gave me a bigger scree? tsoc(some number?
[06/14 13:18] <dsk_hbe> that was for Roscoe, do you use Exceed for these windows?
[06/14 13:18] <JimE_zOS> I access TSO differently than Debbie so I can't say 
[06/14 13:18] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/14 13:18] <dsk_hbe> do you use TPX, Jim?  I think that is what AMit does, right?
[06/14 13:19] <06Amit_ZOS> I know debbie had told me once and it worked too
[06/14 13:19] <02charlie> tsoc132?
[06/14 13:19] <06Amit_ZOS> i logged into tsoc directly
[06/14 13:19] <06Amit_ZOS> no tpx
[06/14 13:19] <dsk_hbe> no, that was just for Roscoe... I do not do anything fancy for TSO, just TSOC
[06/14 13:20] <dsk_hbe> what is your login parameter size when logging into TSO, AMit?  I have this:
[06/14 13:20] <dsk_hbe> Size      ===> 2096128
[06/14 13:21] <06Amit_ZOS> l tpx,m5
[06/14 13:22] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/14 13:22] <06Amit_ZOS> thats the default
[06/14 13:22] <dsk_hbe> I can't help you with TPX, don't use it... outside of tpx, try to login to tsoc but before giving your password, check that parm on the same screen
[06/14 13:23] <dsk_hbe> zm doesn't force the width to 132, so I can't imagine that is the issue.
[06/14 13:23] <06Amit_ZOS> got it to work now
[06/14 13:23] <dsk_hbe> what did you change?
[06/14 13:24] <06Amit_ZOS> used   l tpx,m5
[06/14 13:24] <06Amit_ZOS> logged into tpx and then tsoc
[06/14 13:24] <06Amit_ZOS> you had given me this solution sometime ago
[06/14 13:24] <06Amit_ZOS> i just couldnt recollect it
[06/14 13:24] <06Amit_ZOS> dug up from logs
[06/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> I told you to use m5?  must have dug it out of a very old notebook
[06/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> ok, anyway...
[06/14 13:25] <06Amit_ZOS> its originally from your tpx notes
[06/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> 5 -Change Status
[06/14 13:25] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> next panel, you want the PROD library so 
[06/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> Libraries to choose from: 2
[06/14 13:26] <dsk_hbe> you have the two zap numbers that need closed... choose one of them.
[06/14 13:26] <dsk_hbe> change the status from porudction to closed
[06/14 13:26] <dsk_hbe> and the code fix status from pending to production and list the spi number I have in the doc.
[06/14 13:27] <06Amit_ZOS> what do i put ahead of the member to select?
[06/14 13:27] <dsk_hbe> 's'
[06/14 13:28] <06Amit_ZOS> yes and code fix status ?
[06/14 13:28] <dsk_hbe> and the code fix status from pending to production and list the spi number I have in the doc.
[06/14 13:29] <06Amit_ZOS> just the number 142423 for SPI right?>
[06/14 13:30] <dsk_hbe> yep
[06/14 13:30] <06Amit_ZOS> add comments?
[06/14 13:30] <06Amit_ZOS> or just hit enter to continue?
[06/14 13:30] <dsk_hbe> I never do cause I'm lazy :-)

[06/14 13:31] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/14 13:31] <06Amit_ZOS> will do for the other zap now
[06/14 13:31] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[06/14 13:32] <06Amit_ZOS> same spi though right?
[06/14 13:32] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/14 13:32] <dsk_hbe> yep!
[06/14 13:33] <06Amit_ZOS> so, everything is done now?
[06/14 13:33] <dsk_hbe> if you want to confirm, you can do the thing the doc says, option 8 then option 3 to see if any prod zaps are still open
[06/14 13:34] <dsk_hbe> yep, that's it!
[06/14 13:34] <dsk_hbe> if you wanna, you can add your initials/name to that section of the doc confirming all done.  But we get a little looser about updating the doc post install
[06/14 13:35] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/14 13:36] <06Amit_ZOS> that's okay 
[06/14 13:36] <dsk_hbe> oh and you don't get any of these emails either... sigh... I'll forward you the set for 318R just so you know what your work generates
[06/14 13:36] <06Amit_ZOS> checked using 8.3.. everythings clean
[06/14 13:36] <06Amit_ZOS> no open zaps
[06/14 13:36] <dsk_hbe> awesome
[06/14 13:36] <02charlie> but on the other hand, gail is still getting them :D
[06/14 13:37] <dsk_hbe> yep :-)
[06/14 13:38] <06Amit_ZOS> cool!
[06/14 13:38] <06Amit_ZOS> so all testing of the new mvs release involves just diary checkouts is it?
[06/14 13:38] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I will let you reply to Eric
[06/14 13:39] <06Amit_ZOS> and offcourse the nightly jobs
[06/14 13:39] <02charlie> too late, sorry
[06/14 13:39] <dsk_hbe> nevermind, the kettle got it ;-)
[06/14 13:39] <02charlie> lol
[06/14 13:40] <06Amit_ZOS> oops
[06/14 13:40] <06Amit_ZOS> hhaha
[06/14 13:40] <dsk_hbe> you say 'testing' - testing was done pre-release and the night of install while we were podded.  ANything after that is just wacthing for issues from prod users, which is, yes, diary watching.etc.
[06/14 13:41] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/14 13:43] <06Amit_ZOS> Charlie, did you just do lcre diary checkouts for 1030 to 1200 today?
[06/14 13:43] <06Amit_ZOS> or did you do lsr's as well?
[06/14 13:43] <02charlie> both
[06/14 13:43] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/14 13:44] <06Amit_ZOS> Man, you guys are fast!
[06/14 13:44] <dsk_hbe> way to keep on top of the kettle... I warn you it will keep you busy ;-)
[06/14 13:44] <02charlie> lol
[06/14 13:44] <06Amit_ZOS> :-)
[06/14 13:48] <06Amit_ZOS> guys, do you have any idea how much of a vacation time i can carry over to the next year?
[06/14 13:48] <06Amit_ZOS> is that fixed or is it varied from person to person
[06/14 13:51] <02charlie> they dont want you to carry any over
[06/14 13:51] <02charlie> but you can talk to eric
[06/14 13:51] <06Amit_ZOS> aah
[06/14 13:51] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/14 13:51] <06Amit_ZOS> thank
[06/14 13:51] <06Amit_ZOS> s
[06/14 13:52] <dsk_hbe> sorry... missed the beeps again... you can carry over comp time earier though
[06/14 13:55] <dsk_hbe> that shoudl be easier, in case you cold not decipher it %-}
[06/14 13:57] <06Amit_ZOS> it was easy :D
[06/14 13:58] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/14 14:26] <02charlie> amit, would you do me a favor and run the LCRE diaries for fac?
[06/14 14:26] <02charlie> fabc

[06/14 14:29] <02charlie> thx
[06/14 14:34] <02charlie> amit, do you want to run the diaries from 1400 to 1430?
[06/14 14:34] <06Amit_ZOS> sure, where do I give the time boundaries?
[06/14 14:35] <02charlie> how are you running them?
[06/14 14:35] <02charlie> i dont think the lcre diaries will pay any attention, it's all or nothing
[06/14 14:35] <06Amit_ZOS> the sr's and lfd's using mj.srdiary
[06/14 14:36] <06Amit_ZOS> and lcre using lcreadd
[06/14 14:36] <02charlie> sec, lmc
[06/14 14:36] <dsk_hbe> I will say it again... I don't limit on time personally... just in case... so instead I look at everything and then zone in on the timeframe if need be
[06/14 14:37] <02charlie> i dont think mj.srdiary allows you ti limit the range
[06/14 14:39] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. shall i just do all then?
[06/14 14:39] <02charlie> yep
[06/14 14:40] <dsk_hbe> that's cause I set it up ;-)  Well, I stole it from Wayne years ago, but embellished it ;-)
[06/14 14:40] <dsk_hbe> back when he was on our team
[06/14 14:41] <02charlie> i stole what debbie had and added my own enhancements :)

[06/14 14:41] <02charlie> rotfl
[06/14 14:42] <06Amit_ZOS> and did you want me to run lcreadd once more for fabc?
[06/14 14:42] <02charlie> i got tried of having to run different rpfs for different types of diaries
[06/14 14:42] <dsk_hbe> such a chore
[06/14 14:42] <02charlie> yes, please, since the one you ran before didnt cover the entire period
[06/14 14:42] <06Amit_ZOS> and also, the one i gave you were fabc diaries.. i assumed u wanted those
[06/14 14:42] <02charlie> yes, fabc

[06/14 14:44] <02charlie> did their abends reappear?
[06/14 14:44] <06Amit_ZOS> i dont see any abends
[06/14 14:45] <06Amit_ZOS> in lcre
[06/14 14:45] <06Amit_ZOS> checking lsr's
[06/14 14:50] <06Amit_ZOS> just a few SNNNEW and IOPROC abends here and there
[06/14 14:51] <02charlie> but nothing from 1400 to 1430
[06/14 14:52] <02charlie> * 142024 3006 AB-IBPC4HW,0002,69,IHHEBIGK,H732,3815,00,    ,SCCACC+01464Z01

[06/14 14:56] <02charlie> the SCTDCT+015B8 abend may be a time punch
[06/14 14:57] <dsk_hbe> yep, 02/25 usually mean looping
[06/14 14:59] <02charlie> this abend occurrs occassionally in fabc: SNCTRL+00040
[06/14 14:59] <dsk_hbe> terminal task?
[06/14 15:00] <dsk_hbe> if so, that just usually means that the mom UCE is failing after the subtask UCE(s) did
[06/14 15:00] <02charlie> DICT SUBTASK ERROR 
[06/14 15:00] <dsk_hbe> so likely common, yes
[06/14 15:01] <dsk_hbe> the ones for yesterday were indeed terminal task ablines... the important ones in that case are the subtask ablines (the Z's)

[06/15 09:35] <dsk_hbe> morning
[06/15 09:35] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Debbie!
[06/15 09:36] <dsk_hbe> put myself in XM.  You look lonely here, Amit!  My computer decided to disconnect from VPN last night I guess
[06/15 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> ah
[06/15 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> you have a docking station too?
[06/15 09:38] <dsk_hbe> yeah, well something they call a mini-port
[06/15 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> nice
[06/15 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> there were 147 IOPROCs yesterday!
[06/15 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> *137
[06/15 09:39] <06Amit_ZOS> was that expected?
[06/15 09:39] <dsk_hbe> some persistent pig no doubt... mostly the same user?
[06/15 09:39] <06Amit_ZOS> BMV8DXG
[06/15 09:40] <dsk_hbe> a univeristy ID... I assume code 23 or code 24?  which suggests pig searches and they tried to use more work disk than they are allowed
[06/15 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/15 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> 23
[06/15 09:41] <dsk_hbe> we seem to have a lot of universities spiking up on activity at the end fo the year... probably some sort of assessment period if I had to guess
[06/15 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> PROD	36.13	2017/06/14	06:33:37 	33	BMV8DXG	0005	23	IHHANFMN 	4965	2915	00	....	Z**
[06/15 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> oops
[06/15 09:41] <dsk_hbe> so I wouldn't worry abotu those.  The ablines are really in place to protect the rest of the users from this kind of pig activity
[06/15 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[06/15 09:42] <dsk_hbe> sometimes I wish if they were going to disconnect me they'd just shut the whoel thing down... takes a lot less time than trying to restart a bunch of windows
[06/15 09:43] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, the VPN is very fickle minded

[06/15 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> Hello Folks! :)
[06/15 10:10] <02charlie> good morning amit and debbie
[06/15 10:10] <dsk_hbe> hi guys
[06/15 10:10] <02charlie> gonna walk around and talk to some people
[06/15 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> EHall in the house today!
[06/15 10:11] <dsk_hbe> I heard folks at Hankins' meeting talking about that... like it was a huge deal... it's just Eric... we knew him when he was a peon like us ;-)
[06/15 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> hahaha
[06/15 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> :D
[06/15 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> I'd never seen him though
[06/15 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> will he be there at the application staff meeting?
[06/15 10:13] <dsk_hbe> you hadn't?  Oh, I doubt he'll be at the staff meeting.  You might just have to go say hi in person ;-)
[06/15 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> will do.. he sits opposite to me
[06/15 10:23] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee.  BRB 
[06/15 10:30] <06Amit_ZOS> I have not seen this before..

[06/15 10:30] <06Amit_ZOS> something new?
[06/15 10:31] <dsk_hbe> maybe... likely means we branched out of our code space.
[06/15 10:31] <dsk_hbe> I can take a peek in a few
[06/15 10:32] <06Amit_ZOS> and today's early morning jitters were ugly
[06/15 10:32] <06Amit_ZOS> STAGED.UNENMAX.CL02.DIARIES
[06/15 10:36] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/15 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> Also, the today morning was the unix major release right?
[06/15 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> minus 'the'
[06/15 10:45] <02charlie> jim, 753, is that a racf issue?
[06/15 10:45] <dsk_hbe> that is scheduled for tonight, Amit
[06/15 10:45] <dsk_hbe> third Thursday of the night month
[06/15 10:45] <02charlie> JCL ERROR  753
[06/15 10:45] <06Amit_ZOS> and is that the same as the zlfd releasE?
[06/15 10:45] <JimE_zOS> I wouldn't think so. 
[06/15 10:46] <JimE_zOS> where can I find the failed job, Charlie? 
[06/15 10:47] <06Amit_ZOS> the reason i ask is, I wanted to know if we expect the SNNNEW ablines to stop
[06/15 10:48] <02charlie> nevermind, let me try something else jim
[06/15 10:48] <JimE_zOS> k...sure 
[06/15 10:48] <dsk_hbe> not with the UNIX release, Amit... hopefully with Joe's zlfd release on 6/29
[06/15 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[06/15 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks debbie!
[06/15 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/15 10:49] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/15 10:56] <dsk_hbe> ok, Amit... looking at your stuff now... was busy with Wayne for a few
[06/15 10:57] <dsk_hbe> ah, did you notice this in that diary, just ahead of the abline:
[06/15 10:57] <dsk_hbe> * 083404 2625 DBMT CMD FORCED USER OFF DB/GEN: B169WMW05SRFX 0910/0533 MKUN
[06/15 10:57] <dsk_hbe> * 083405 2606 AB-B05SRFX,0001,02,IHHLLMBM,0910,0533,00,    ,YYYYYY+FC3A2Z##
[06/15 10:57] <dsk_hbe>   083405 2612 USER 05SRFX-UNRCV ABEND - UCEABCODE = 0002 - PCBSTIX = 00
[06/15 10:58] <dsk_hbe> I'm kind of surprised that generates an '02' abline.  Let me ask Vickie and Wayne.  I'll copy you.
[06/15 10:59] <06Amit_ZOS> no, i had just extracted the ablines unsing chkdry
[06/15 10:59] <06Amit_ZOS> now looking
[06/15 11:00] <dsk_hbe> it is an asterisk'd line.  I woudl have thought chkdry woudl have hit it
[06/15 11:00] <JimE_zOS> good lesson that the ab- line isn't hte only thing of value in a diary. 
[06/15 11:00] <dsk_hbe> yes it is!
[06/15 11:00] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes it is..
[06/15 11:01] <06Amit_ZOS> i usually look at find them and look at the actual diary after i see something interesting.. was just waiting to see what debbie says
[06/15 11:02] <dsk_hbe> ah well, don't ever wait on me... like Jim and Charlie I'm usually juggling too much to be waited on ;-)
[06/15 11:02] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, just in this case.. was also following up with other stuff.. :P
[06/15 11:03] <06Amit_ZOS> so the user was taken off that DB.. is that what it means?
[06/15 11:03] <dsk_hbe> yes
[06/15 11:03] <06Amit_ZOS> interesting
[06/15 11:04] <dsk_hbe> due to this MKUN, which isn't asterisk'd
[06/15 11:04] <dsk_hbe>   083404 2610  CPU    MKUN 0910 0533     01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
[06/15 11:05] <06Amit_ZOS> so will i need to look at that doc?
[06/15 11:06] <dsk_hbe> nope
[06/15 11:06] <dsk_hbe> nothing to look at... simply the db/gen he was trying to use was scratched so we don't want users trying to use it so we knock them off.  Waht I am asking the devs is if it is unusual to end up with the code 02 abline.  I suspect they will just say no.
[06/15 11:08] <06Amit_ZOS> why? what does 02 abline signify?
[06/15 11:09] <dsk_hbe> program check.  Email sent
[06/15 11:09] <dsk_hbe> the abend codes are all listed int he UCEDSECT in LMS for each piece of the OLS, if you want to get more familiar with them.  Some of them just become well known after a well.
[06/15 11:10] <dsk_hbe> after a while... sorry, too many things dinging at me ;-)
[06/15 11:10] <06Amit_ZOS> sorry, i did a triveni there... i asked the question before attempting to answer it myself!
[06/15 11:10] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/15 11:15] <JimE_zOS> BTW, Debbie, in case it helps you find the Magna Carta, it was sealed on this day in 1215 :-)
[06/15 11:17] <dsk_hbe> oh thanks!!!! ;-)
[06/15 11:22] <dsk_hbe> anyone use 'batch' mode for smapi reporting?  Learned today that it seems to not like long reports... ran one for a user who had 253 searches in the time period I was looking at and smapi batch only sent me about 40.  Making batch useless to me.  FYI
[06/15 11:26] <JimE_zOS> I'd love to use it, Debbie....and I've tried, but no luck. 
[06/15 11:26] <JimE_zOS> started to ask JimC for help but got interrupted. 
[06/15 11:26] <dsk_hbe> I can try to help!
[06/15 11:27] <JimE_zOS> oh, no, wait.  I'm confused. 
[06/15 11:27] <JimE_zOS> I'm trying to do something other than batch 
[06/15 11:29] <02charlie> the YYYYYY abends always mean we made a db unavailable to a user while it was in use
[06/15 11:30] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah i see.. 
[06/15 11:31] <02charlie> sorry still sitting with RD people
[06/15 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> going for lunch now..
[06/15 11:58] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/15 12:17] <JimE_zOS> Charlie? 
[06/15 12:17] <02charlie> yes
[06/15 12:17] <JimE_zOS> What are you trying to do to Amit's datasets? 
[06/15 12:18] <JimE_zOS> 06/14/17  14:31:23   SYSC   ULESTCX  TD003     ........  DATASET   UNENMAX.FABC.DEMAND.T142809.LCRE.D170614     
[06/15 12:18] <JimE_zOS> 06/14/17  14:31:23   SYSC   ULESTCX  TD003     ........  DATASET   UNENMAX.FABC.DEMAND.T142809.LCRELIB.D170614  
[06/15 12:18] <02charlie> i was trying to use them to do my analysis, but the jcl was trying to create some too, i evenetually fixed the jcl
[06/15 12:18] <02charlie> so it now properly uses them, but creates the output ones under my uid
[06/15 12:19] <02charlie> so you should see 
[06/15 12:19] <02charlie> ULESTCX.FABC.DEMAND.T142809.LCRE.D170614 and ULESTCX.FABC.DEMAND.T142809.LCRELIB.D170614
[06/15 12:19] <02charlie> well should have
[06/15 12:20] <JimE_zOS> so you were trying to ALTER them. 
[06/15 12:20] <JimE_zOS> that would explain the RACF exception
[06/15 12:20] <02charlie> well, i think i actually created them too
[06/15 12:20] <JimE_zOS> you have UPDATE authority, not ALTER, BTW 
[06/15 12:20] <JimE_zOS> don't think so. 
[06/15 12:20] <JimE_zOS> creation requires ALTER. 
[06/15 12:20] <02charlie> i think so, let me find the job for you
[06/15 12:21] <02charlie> ULESTCXA J057381
[06/15 12:21] <02charlie> cataloged the dataset, but then wouldnt let me do anything with it
[06/15 12:22] <02charlie> i think this is the job where i fixed the jcl: ULESTCXA J168253
[06/15 12:23] <02charlie> my problem was that my JCL usually went against my own datasets, so i never ran into the issue
[06/15 12:24] <JimE_zOS> actually, I don't think it created the datasets at all.  I suspect you created catalog entries only. 
[06/15 12:24] <02charlie> yeah, that's what i think
[06/15 12:24] <JimE_zOS> which, BTW, doesn't thrill me. 
[06/15 12:25] <02charlie> as it shouldnt
[06/15 12:25] <JimE_zOS> I don't think that should have worked either. 
[06/15 12:25] <02charlie> if i dont have alter access for that dsname, i shouldnt be able to catalog it either
[06/15 12:25] <JimE_zOS> unless UPDATE authority is enough to catalog a user dataset. 
[06/15 12:26] <JimE_zOS> that is a different control
[06/15 12:26] <JimE_zOS> and as I recently learned, it only takes UPDATE authority to CATALOG.USER.* to create a user dataset. 
[06/15 12:26] <JimE_zOS> everybody has UPDATE to that profile 
[06/15 12:27] <JimE_zOS> so I get why the dataset creation correctly failed and the catalog entry was created. 
[06/15 12:27] <JimE_zOS> not a fan, but I understand it. 
[06/15 13:13] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/15 13:58] <06Amit_zOS> splash of coffee. BRB 
[06/15 13:58] <06Amit_zOS> :D
[06/15 14:07] <dsk_hbe> ok, Charlie, no helping Amit... let's let him see if he can figure out this FABC zlfd error himself
[06/15 14:07] <dsk_hbe> shortlived so there is plenty of time for him to play with this.
[06/15 14:10] <06Amit_zOS> oh ok then
[06/15 14:10] <02charlie> ok
[06/15 14:10] <02charlie> i've been chatting people up all day, i think im back at my desk for a while
[06/15 14:10] <dsk_hbe> you have the tools... ask questions, but we won't give you answers that are goign to nudge too much... and it can be carried over to after staffer too, no probelm
[06/15 14:12] <dsk_hbe> and even to tomorrow ;-)
[06/15 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you for the time! :) I will figure this out
[06/15 14:13] <dsk_hbe> I have faith that you will!
[06/15 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> Don't know why smapi is not showing me the errors.. i can see them in the uss logs!
[06/15 14:38] <dsk_hbe> FIRST CLUE... AND THIS IS A CONFUSING ONE... i ALWAYS HAVE TO THINKA BOUT IT... SOME OF THE FABC SPECIFIC STUFF GOES TO THE... UM, CAPS OFF NOW.... to the prod dimestore and others  to the cert dimestore... so you need smapi for cert here
[06/15 14:38] <dsk_hbe> do you have that URL?
[06/15 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> i think so
[06/15 14:39] <dsk_hbe> let me know if you can't find it bookmarked
[06/15 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> got it
[06/15 14:40] <dsk_hbe> cool
[06/15 14:40] <02charlie> ok, heading to staffer
[06/15 15:39] <06Amit_zOS> quick technical question..
[06/15 15:39] <dsk_hbe> yes sir?
[06/15 15:39] <06Amit_zOS> need to see ausm in fabc.. where do i login and look?
[06/15 15:39] <02charlie> well this is really interesting:

[06/15 15:39] <dsk_hbe> the prod ausm relates to FABC as well...t he same physocal databases are used by both
[06/15 15:40] <02charlie> note there's very little in the K0 diskstat file, but nothing in K1
[06/15 15:40] <02charlie> and yet I know K1 has done work today:
[06/15 15:40] <06Amit_zOS> so if a database is updated in fabc, it should show up in ausm today?
[06/15 15:40] <dsk_hbe> are those backups?  I forget what is what
[06/15 15:40] <dsk_hbe> yes, Amit

[06/15 15:42] <dsk_hbe> so if they are just essentially backup copies, Charlie, they'd not have much in the way of diskstats with no users sending browses, but would still have all the normal diary messages as the copy stays up and spits out regular heartbeat stuff
[06/15 15:42] <02charlie> no, those should be the live files
[06/15 15:43] <dsk_hbe> I think you are missing my point... sec
[06/15 15:43] <02charlie> looks like most of the work is done on L0 & L1, but anita got all her abends on K0 & K1
[06/15 15:44] <dsk_hbe> sec
[06/15 15:44] <02charlie> so i would think they should have some data

[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> if you look at the normal CS usage on the FABC LFDs, you will see that teh copies that use 1895 (where the K copies are) get very little use.  Here is the config:
[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> 045051 8312 F ALTCRB1         TR001010
[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> 045107 8512 F ALTCRB1         TR001011
[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> 045116 8712 F ALTCRB1         TR001010
[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> 045109 9012 F ALTCRB1         TR001011
[06/15 15:47] <dsk_hbe> 045119 9112 F ALTCRB1         TR001010
[06/15 15:49] <dsk_hbe> Also, at least at one time I lived under the understanding that if you failed a browse in cre land, no diskstat was written... so 1) eitehr she pushed to one of the K-using LFDs and her trans failed or 2) her trans failed on the most used copy (85) and failed over to the L* copies and failed there too... still no diskstats.
[06/15 15:49] <02charlie> yes, but they do get some, and in fact we have the DART record from K1 that showed up for anita. SHouldn't we have soe value > 0 in DSKST.D0615.CPK1.T044824 and a tie stam > 4:48?
[06/15 15:49] <dsk_hbe> maybe we do now write diskstats and if so, Anita's may be the few you found on the one K copy
[06/15 15:51] <dsk_hbe> very little goes to the K copies, Charlie... it's been that way forever
[06/15 15:52] <02charlie> and im not bothered by that, i'm bothered by the fact that i see activity on K1, and yet there are no diskstat records for it
[06/15 15:52] <dsk_hbe> yesterday we had one single trans go directly to a K copy
[06/15 15:52] <dsk_hbe> what activity?  heck I'll go look, sec
[06/15 15:53] <02charlie> we've got this:
[06/15 15:53] <02charlie> @ 092359 K1BI DART=000021 5MIN ART=000021 HIGH=000035/BLAZAK LOW=000012
[06/15 15:54] <dsk_hbe> still could have been failed trans
[06/15 15:54] <dsk_hbe> and last I knew we do not write a diskstat for a failed trans
[06/15 15:54] <02charlie> i guess, but anita was trying to make an abend and didnt succeed until this afternoon wth the CREIDR ones
[06/15 15:56] <06Amit_zOS>  Ok, here is my finding... as i understand it the issue was that we got the jdbutil access error 11 times from 20170615-13:52:05:191 to
[06/15 15:56] <06Amit_zOS> 20170615-13:52:14:511 1399706 all on the same DB Z391 on csi#280434 (thanks to Anita now i know what that means)
[06/15 15:56] <06Amit_zOS> Also, Z391 was ONDB'd on 135025 on copy C0. I would suspect that is the reason why we got the errors!?
[06/15 15:56] <dsk_hbe> don't know what to tell you but to your original question... K* copies are pretty much backups
[06/15 15:56] <02charlie> ok, i'll stop worrying about it :) thx!
[06/15 15:57] <dsk_hbe> hold on a sec amit
[06/15 15:58] <06Amit_zOS> made a boo boo..
[06/15 15:58] <06Amit_zOS> wait a sec for me too
[06/15 15:58] <06Amit_zOS> need to correct that statement
[06/15 15:58] <dsk_hbe> not exactly, but I think there is more to it... for one thing you only mention C0... but C0 is for browse and jnorm processes searches
[06/15 15:59] <dsk_hbe> and also that we don't run a CRE copy in FABC ;-)
[06/15 16:00] <dsk_hbe> so the CRE work is done in the LSR copies... we only have 30 and 35 for FABC
[06/15 16:00] <06Amit_zOS> yes i know.. boo boo

[06/15 16:05] <06Amit_zOS> not the error, 
[06/15 16:06] <02charlie> before i forget, i have a 9am errand to run tomorrow. leaving about 840, back by about 0930
[06/15 16:06] <06Amit_zOS> i meant it completed successfully on copy 30 and 35
[06/15 16:06] <dsk_hbe> ok, wasn't sure when you said 10 and 30
[06/15 16:07] <dsk_hbe> let me show oyu something that you likely have not seen before, AMit.  Go to Service Now, on the left go to KNowledge Base, then choose Error Exception.  Read that one about this particular error
[06/15 16:11] <06Amit_zOS> I saw your post there!
[06/15 16:11] <dsk_hbe> so remember how we have talked about FABC's priority compared to PROD?
[06/15 16:12] <06Amit_zOS> its at lower priority
[06/15 16:12] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/15 16:12] <dsk_hbe> did oyu flag my article?  I got an email!  silly tool
[06/15 16:13] <06Amit_zOS> i liked it and said it was helpful
[06/15 16:14] <dsk_hbe> ah!  I found the entry and it says it's empty ;-)
[06/15 16:15] <dsk_hbe> I guess because you just picked an opton and didn't add further comment... howweird... silly tool
[06/15 16:16] <dsk_hbe> ok, let me ask you a leading question or two, Amit... do you know what copy handles the promote commands from ausm? 
[06/15 16:16] <06Amit_zOS> 06?
[06/15 16:17] <dsk_hbe> in production, yes!  very good... in FABC it is the SA1 copy... it is wherever HCP runs, fwiw
[06/15 16:17] <dsk_hbe> ok, so, my diary shows me that the FABC sa1 copy got the commands for the new gen here:

[06/15 16:18] <dsk_hbe> now, next tricky question.  What copy in the OLS will feed the database information to zlfd applications?
[06/15 16:19] <dsk_hbe> tricky because we may not have gotten into thsi with you, not sure
[06/15 16:20] <06Amit_zOS> just a sec
[06/15 16:21] <dsk_hbe> I think I will add value to that question by sharing somethign else we may not have shared with you before.  Can you go to the FABC Fcards and browse the current set
[06/15 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> i don't see a fcards.fabc
[06/15 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> is it in tsow

[06/15 16:23] <dsk_hbe> be sure to use the NZ00 name
[06/15 16:23] <dsk_hbe> we must not have had you change fabc fcards yet
[06/15 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> in it now
[06/15 16:24] <dsk_hbe> do a find on 'JLFD'
[06/15 16:24] <dsk_hbe> this describes a lot about what we do with our communication to the zlfd apps.  JLFD pre-dates zlfd... a name from the system it replaced
[06/15 16:25] <dsk_hbe> now, the zlfd app that handles updates to the oracle database that holds DB/gen info is jdbutil
[06/15 16:25] <dsk_hbe> so page down past all those comments... you can read those later.
[06/15 16:25] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/15 16:25] <dsk_hbe> down at the part that lays out the parm switches for each app... note which switch is for jdbutil
[06/15 16:26] <dsk_hbe> see if you can understabd from this which copies will send the db updates to zlfd for fabc
[06/15 16:32] <dsk_hbe> have I lost you?  sorry... I know this is new and so hard to do over irc
[06/15 16:32] <06Amit_zOS> 08 and 18?
[06/15 16:32] <06Amit_zOS> wild guess
[06/15 16:33] <dsk_hbe> no, sorry... I let you struggle on that one too long.
[06/15 16:33] <06Amit_zOS> i did not understand 
[06/15 16:33] <dsk_hbe> here are the parms:
[06/15 16:33] <dsk_hbe> 2 JLFD=YNYYNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN,ORACLEDB=FABC0818     83
[06/15 16:33] <dsk_hbe> 2 JLFD=YYYYNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN,ORACLEDB=FABC0818     FD
[06/15 16:33] <06Amit_zOS> second one JDBUTIL is active
[06/15 16:33] <dsk_hbe> the comments above them say that the second swithc, switch #1 (why they start with 0 to throw everyone off I don't know ;-)
[06/15 16:34] <dsk_hbe> off to the right are the copies those values apply to
[06/15 16:34] <dsk_hbe> for LFD83, do we send database commands to zlfd?
[06/15 16:34] <dsk_hbe> his second switch is 'N'
[06/15 16:35] <dsk_hbe> but all the rest of the LFDs, represented by the 'FD" set of parms, can send commands
[06/15 16:35] <dsk_hbe> given that... and knowing what time the LSA onlined the gen, can oyu check the FABC LFD copies and see if you see the issue?
[06/15 16:35] <06Amit_zOS> haha
[06/15 16:36] <06Amit_zOS> that was tough to decipher
[06/15 16:36] <dsk_hbe> yeah, some tribal knowledge needed there :-(
[06/15 16:44] <06Amit_zOS> 135203 8510 ......  RELS Z391 1352     00-LSR DB COMMAND SENT TO JLFD
[06/15 16:44] <dsk_hbe> yeah, lets ignore those... they are confusing to me... I suspect somewhere we have some really old gen info for this base... move on to the chpg command
[06/15 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> the chpg happend late
[06/15 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> 135216 8310  CPU    CHPG Z391 13520005 01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
[06/15 16:45] <dsk_hbe> yes... now, what time was the LSA command?
[06/15 16:46] <dsk_hbe> here it is:
[06/15 16:46] <dsk_hbe> 135203 0110         CHPG Z391 13520005 01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
[06/15 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/15 16:46] <dsk_hbe> now, what time were your zlfd errors?
[06/15 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> 135205
[06/15 16:47] <06Amit_zOS> hence the problem
[06/15 16:47] <dsk_hbe> and the last one?
[06/15 16:47] <06Amit_zOS> last one at 135214
[06/15 16:48] <dsk_hbe> so yeah, you got it... normal FABC slowness... one LFD finally sent the info to zlfd, he updated his oracle info and life was happy
[06/15 16:48] <06Amit_zOS> so after 135216, it found the new gen online and there was no probs
[06/15 16:48] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/15 16:48] <dsk_hbe> I am still going to give that bogus release command some thought, but not today... and if I forget by tomorrow, maybe never ;-)
[06/15 16:48] <dsk_hbe> one=once 
[06/15 16:49] <06Amit_zOS> so what do i do for the ticket?
[06/15 16:49] <06Amit_zOS> jsut add the comments?
[06/15 16:49] <dsk_hbe> I probably ended up tellign you more than you needed me to, but once I realized thre was some stuff in there that we likely hadn't talked about yet, I figrued I'd better not let you struggle... hope you learned a little
[06/15 16:49] <dsk_hbe> yes, just close it with somments to that effect... that fabc's normal low priority slowed things down
[06/15 16:50] <06Amit_zOS> a little? im worried how im gonna remember this and explain it to Triveni!
[06/15 16:50] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[06/15 16:50] <dsk_hbe> especially since it doesn't happen very often!
[06/15 16:50] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/15 16:50] <dsk_hbe> I thik just saving snips of the fabc diaries will be good... since we only keep fabc diaries for 7 days
[06/15 16:50] <06Amit_zOS> will do it maybe later tonight.. no hurry right?
[06/15 16:51] <dsk_hbe> none at all!
[06/15 16:51] <dsk_hbe> I shoudl get going too.
[06/15 16:51] <dsk_hbe> Charlie I am going to put you back in daytime
[06/15 16:52] <02charlie> sure, you're very late today :)
[06/15 16:52] <dsk_hbe> stupid staff meeting ;-)
[06/15 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> sorry to keep you waiting Debbie..
[06/15 16:52] <02charlie> i'll run my errand in the morning
[06/15 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> thank you so much for all the help! :)
[06/15 16:52] <02charlie> if amit can handle things, i wont take the boat anchor, but i can take it with me if necessary
[06/15 16:52] <dsk_hbe> no way, Amit, sharing with you is our number one priority!
[06/15 16:53] <dsk_hbe> HOw about this, Charlie, I will be home when you leave, can you put me in your place.  IF nothing else he can page me out of the shower :-)
[06/15 16:53] <02charlie> and debbie's lesson reinforced my knwldege too
[06/15 16:54] <02charlie> i can do that debbie
[06/15 16:54] <dsk_hbe> cool, thanks!

[06/16 09:30] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[06/16 09:30] <dsk_hbe> morning
[06/16 09:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Morning Debbie! :)
[06/16 09:32] <dsk_hbe> I see Charlie added me to daytime but left himself in.  Removed him
[06/16 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Debbie, was just about filling in the comments on snow for that ticket
[06/16 09:52] <dsk_hbe> cool
[06/16 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> which chpg commands do i highlight? just these two?
[06/16 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> 135216 8310  CPU    CHPG Z391 13520005 01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

[06/16 09:53] <dsk_hbe> I think that spells it out nicely yes... the SA starts the process, but LFD is slow to get to it's part
[06/16 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/16 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> so here is my comment:
[06/16 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> By looking at the logs and the information extracted via the SMAPI application, we see that there were 11 of these errors, the first one at 13:52:05 and the last one being at 13:52:15. All were complaining about the Database with CSI=280434 and DB=35391[Z391]. By checking the OLS fabc diaries, :
[06/16 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> 135203 0110         CHPG Z391 13520005 01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
[06/16 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> The LSA  had the new gen online at 13:52:03. However all the LFD's got the database CHPG commands late attributing the lower priority of fabc as compared to prod systems:
[06/16 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> 135216 8310  CPU    CHPG Z391 13520005 01-OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.
[06/16 10:01] <dsk_hbe> EXCELLENT!
[06/16 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> *DB=35391[Z391] being unavailable
[06/16 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks :-)
[06/16 10:07] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[06/16 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Did Jim get an early morning page today?
[06/16 10:15] <02charlie> im sure he did
[06/16 10:15] <dsk_hbe> yes, no fun one eitehr... he had to edit PBR dta to get it running.
[06/16 10:15] <02charlie> he also got one last night probably after midnight
[06/16 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> :-(
[06/16 10:16] <dsk_hbe> long running release... I almost hope they forgot to page him again :-/
[06/16 10:16] <02charlie> he was running diaries at 0049
[06/16 10:17] <dsk_hbe> I knew that was too good to be true
[06/16 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> need a splash of coffee. BRB
[06/16 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> :D
[06/16 10:19] <02charlie> hmm. i need more than just a splash. you and jim get by on those splashes, i think i need a 55 gallon drium :)
[06/16 10:19] <02charlie> drum
[06/16 10:21] <dsk_hbe> tea here... many days wish I liked coffee ;-)
[06/16 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> i never used to drink coffee back home in India..
[06/16 10:24] <06Amit_ZOS> I think coffee was an American influence
[06/16 10:25] <02charlie> yeah, the indian friends we went to dinner with Tuesday evening drink coffee, but it's usually tea for them
[06/16 10:25] <02charlie> and sweet
[06/16 10:25] <02charlie> with milk
[06/16 10:26] <06Amit_ZOS> Tea is very prominent.. my mom drinks at least about 5 times a day

[06/16 11:22] <JimE_zOS> gonna hang here a sec...question RE: lync 
[06/16 11:22] <02charlie> sure
[06/16 11:22] <JimE_zOS> from Chuck Ehrstine....the Capt. of GEIS Bad Security Practices. 
[06/16 11:26] <dsk_hbe> was on the phone but off now and hiya, Jim :-)
[06/16 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim!
[06/16 11:29] <JimE_zOS> howdy! 
[06/16 11:29] <JimE_zOS> I hope this release didn't introduce a PBR issue 
[06/16 11:29] <JimE_zOS> cause I really hate editing data. 
[06/16 11:29] <dsk_hbe> gosh I hope not... that editting thing si not a ton of fun
[06/16 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> I would imagine so... again.. not the kinda solution we like!
[06/16 11:32] <dsk_hbe> if you want to get an idea of what Jim had to do, Amit, in our sharepoint, under the PBR section, is a doc called epbrbtfm.  not fun at all!
[06/16 11:33] <JimE_zOS> oh, he'll get an idea, all right.  I saved off the problem dataset just so the kids can practice 
[06/16 11:33] <dsk_hbe> awecome!!!!
[06/16 11:34] <dsk_hbe> or somethign like that :-}
[06/16 11:34] <06Amit_ZOS> I smell an assignment coming up............
[06/16 11:35] <JimE_zOS> several assignments, actually. 
[06/16 11:35] <06Amit_ZOS> yay!..
[06/16 11:35] <JimE_zOS> including one for me.  I have an idea for a tool that might help us with this particular data flaw. 
[06/16 11:35] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh cool!
[06/16 11:36] <06Amit_ZOS> we can talk about it sometime!
[06/16 11:36] <JimE_zOS> we just won't tell Triveni about the tool :-)
[06/16 11:36] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[06/16 11:36] <06Amit_ZOS> lol... sure!
[06/16 11:37] <02charlie> lol
[06/16 11:38] <02charlie> without looking, is that the one where you have to use FM to fix the dataset?
[06/16 11:40] <02charlie> connie, the fix for the rampdown issue is a change in the JCLEMPTY member itself, to use the LIBRARY variable passed in by the job
[06/16 11:40] <02charlie> I'll put it in L1 QALIBS
[06/16 11:40] <02charlie> i'm still looking at the PLGHARC job
[06/16 11:40] <dsk_hbe> ww, CHarlie
[06/16 11:41] <02charlie> sheesh
[06/16 11:41] <02charlie> thx
[06/16 11:41] <dsk_hbe> yes, file manager
[06/16 11:41] <02charlie> why cant they hear me from here :)
[06/16 11:41] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/16 11:42] <JimE_zOS> yes, FM, but not to edit the middle of a dataset.  I just had to fix the EOF marker. 
[06/16 11:42] <JimE_zOS> k....done with Capt. Insecurity so heading for campus. 
[06/16 11:42] <dsk_hbe> becausewho knows what the heck they have done to the data itself %-/
[06/16 11:42] <JimE_zOS> back online shortly.
[06/16 11:42] <JimE_zOS> so very true. 
[06/16 11:43] <JimE_zOS> Ask me how! 
[06/16 11:43] <JimE_zOS> :-)

[06/16 12:18] <dsk_hbe> hey Charlie... it doesn't count if I didn't get it and I didn't get it ;-)
[06/16 12:22] <dsk_hbe> and now Amit has beat you too ;-)
[06/16 12:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh actually i got Charlie's!

[06/16 12:32] <JimE_zOS> stupid IRC banned me. 
[06/16 12:32] <dsk_hbe> how annoying
[06/16 12:32] <06Amit_ZOS> thats why i created an SS-mvs team in outlook so that i dont have to add anyone individually
[06/16 12:33] <dsk_hbe> that's what I do, yep... saves my ever-present fat-fingering some... not all, but some ;-)
[06/16 12:33] <02charlie> j<enter>d<enter>t<enter>am<enter> usually gets everyone

[06/16 12:36] <dsk_hbe> you pretty much only have to type s for that ;-)

[06/16 14:48] <dsk_hbe> usually they are the unsupported language country code issue... I think we talked about those before... do you find that in your notes anywhere?
[06/16 14:49] <dsk_hbe> it is the one I had Don Perkind ignore for us to keep us from getting paged on an issue we can do nothing baout.  
[06/16 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> yup its there
[06/16 14:49] <dsk_hbe> the numbers increased dramatically recently and were causing a ton of pages
[06/16 14:49] <dsk_hbe> oh cool
[06/16 14:49] <dsk_hbe> I'll stop yapping then :-)

[06/16 14:53] <dsk_hbe> 10:47 is when they fixed the Diligence healthcheck processing (see #ss) just in case it was unusually high... that had left Diligence cusomters to do bitmap caching that the healthcheck ID predominantly does.
[06/16 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/16 14:55] <dsk_hbe> I'm not sure I'd call those numbers unusually high... do you thikt hey are compared to past days?
[06/16 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> no.. not really, i dont consider it unusually high but usually we dont see so many guys up there do we?
[06/16 14:56] <dsk_hbe> you mean different IDs?
[06/16 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/16 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> just must be pure traffic then
[06/16 14:57] <dsk_hbe> I might buy that.  The Diligence healthcheck ID is usually the #1 FG CPU user but I don't knwo how frequently he shows up in the ARTs... often those IDs are the folks that are victims of someone else's abuse since the stats in those diary messages are based on wall time, not CPU
[06/16 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> right
[06/16 14:58] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I checked a couple of those IDs and they are schools... it may very well be that this is still the end of year school activity I mentioned in my status report
[06/16 14:59] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/16 15:31] <dsk_hbe> well, it's 3:30 and I am tired of looking at zlfd logs that I have to keep unzipping to do the investigation I am doing so I am going to just calmly set it aside and call it a week.  I don't fly out until Tuesday in case anyone needs me, though do have a couple appointments on Monday during teh day.  I will also have my phone with me on my trip.
[06/16 15:31] <dsk_hbe> I hope you all have a good week!
[06/16 15:31] <02charlie> have a good vacatiob debbie
[06/16 15:31] <02charlie> safe travels
[06/16 15:32] <06Amit_zOS> Have a good vacation debbie!
[06/16 15:32] <dsk_hbe> thanks!  I almost forgot, but have mnow removed me from sdaytime and added you back in Charlie
[06/16 15:32] <02charlie> ah, thx debbie
[06/16 15:32] <dsk_hbe> your xm dominance is almost whole again ;-)
[06/16 15:32] <02charlie> i will be running an errand monday morning, but i will keep xm for that

[06/19 09:23] <02charlie> good morning amit
[06/19 09:25] <JimE_zOS> Charlie?  I owe you some time.  Would you like me to cover for you family dinner? 
[06/19 09:25] <06Amit_ZOS> Good Morning Charlie! :)
[06/19 09:28] <06Amit_ZOS> Howdy Jim!
[06/19 09:30] <02charlie> perhaps. still want to find out if i need cellular access to get pages if i have wifi access. They have cell phone signal at the top of their drive, just not in the house at the bottom of the drive :)
[06/19 09:30] <02charlie> ok, i'm going to run my errands
[06/19 09:30] * charlie is now known as charlie_away
[06/19 11:17] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[06/19 11:18] <02charlie> that took longer than i wanted, but i ran more than one errand, tho i wanted to run one more
[06/19 11:21] <02charlie> im going to apply software changes now, apparently if i dont they'll apply them on 6/23
[06/19 11:21] <02charlie> :(
[06/19 11:23] <JimE_zOS> don't you just love being "helped"? 
[06/19 11:23] <02charlie> yeah
[06/19 11:40] <02charlie> this is taking an enormous amount of time
[06/19 11:41] <02charlie> oh, and they want me to change my password in 13 days. i might end up doing that too, otherwise ill be out on pto and forget what i changed it to
[06/19 11:44] <JimE_zOS> more "help".  Aren't you the lucky one. 
[06/19 11:54] <06Amit_ZOS> Several FDRETC today durning the 10 am hour.. BDP2C9J.. any insights?
[06/19 11:57] <JimE_zOS> I'll offer one.  The leading "B" isn't part of the ID (assuming that came from a diary message). 
[06/19 11:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes.
[06/19 11:57] <02charlie> FDRETC+0000A?
[06/19 11:57] <JimE_zOS> in the diary, the leading character (the BIC indicator)....I see you know already 
[06/19 11:57] <06Amit_ZOS> was lazy to take that out
[06/19 11:57] <JimE_zOS> k....nevermind. 
[06/19 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> FDRETC+0000AT**
[06/19 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/19 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> last time this happened there was a test going on or something
[06/19 11:58] <02charlie> not unusual
[06/19 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> the michigan prison guy
[06/19 12:00] <02charlie> it's description is "Newmail error" typically happens when we flush transactions
[06/19 12:00] <02charlie> and as you pointed out, he's the michigan prison id
[06/19 12:01] <06Amit_ZOS> where did you get the description charlie?
[06/19 12:01] <02charlie> well, as usual, i cheated :)
[06/19 12:04] <02charlie> the abend descriptions are given in the email i send with the abend analysis, when they show up
[06/19 12:04] <02charlie> so if you still have the "24 May 2017   LFD/LSR  Historical Message and Abend Analysis for Production (D6)" email
[06/19 12:04] <02charlie> it's there
[06/19 12:04] <06Amit_ZOS> TIMEOUT ON LSR GETMAIL, 119 
[06/19 12:05] <02charlie> but i actually executed "tso similar FDRETC+0000A" get get it (fastest way for me)
[06/19 12:07] <02charlie> what time were they occurring?
[06/19 12:07] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah so this is the description i found "BO FDRETC: TIMEOUT ON LSR GETMAIL, 119 "
[06/19 12:08] <02charlie> that's the BO message
[06/19 12:08] <02charlie> which may be associated with the abend
[06/19 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> from 10:18 to 10 26 am
[06/19 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> mostly on cl09
[06/19 12:09] <02charlie> i'd say the BO and FDRETC+0000A abends aren't directly related
[06/19 12:10] <02charlie> just looking at the stats on both
[06/19 12:11] <06Amit_ZOS> and also there was something i haven't seen in the abend summary report: 'PINANS+0082AT0' just 3 of them though
[06/19 12:12] <06Amit_ZOS>  072029 9506 AB-B9C0PXZ,0001,25,IHKDHEAC,0000,0000,00,,,,,,PINANS+0082AT01
[06/19 12:14] <02charlie> hasnt occurred at all this year, only 2 times in all of 2016, and only once each time
[06/19 12:15] <02charlie> ok, i need to reboot, be back asap

[06/19 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> so how does it work? are you on PTO tomorrow?
[06/19 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> or is it considered training?
[06/19 12:25] <02charlie> no, that usually counts as training
[06/19 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> awesome!
[06/19 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[06/19 12:26] <02charlie> thanks jim

[06/19 12:51] <02charlie> k
[06/19 12:52] <02charlie> im gonna run thru password change now
[06/19 13:17] <02charlie> ok, i think ive changed it most everywhere except exchange, and i've run searches with the new pwd in the products to make sure the uid doesnt disappear 
[06/19 13:17] <02charlie> now for exchange
[06/19 13:17] <02charlie> and i think to do it right i should reboot after ive done it

[06/19 13:26] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/19 13:38] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah, had a good session from anita as to come to a conclusion that it is totally worthless to make a fuss about the FDRETC issue!
[06/19 13:38] <02charlie> :)
[06/19 13:38] <06Amit_ZOS> and learnt a lot by the way we came to that conclusion! :)
[06/19 13:39] <06Amit_ZOS> now i will take that lunch of mine!
[06/19 13:39] <06Amit_ZOS>  :P

[06/19 13:46] <02charlie> doh! the 25 abend code in PINANS was a timepunch
[06/19 14:34] <02charlie> that was an extremely pleasant helpdesk experience
[06/19 14:41] <JimE_zOS> I didn't know there was such a thing
[06/19 14:59] <06Amit_zOS> back!
[06/19 15:14] <02charlie> yeah, surprising, i know
[06/19 15:14] <02charlie> btw CHG0158290 is scheduled and f-cards are prepped
[06/19 15:15] <02charlie> i thought amit had done enough of those, and i am oncall, so i dceided to do it iself (as my daughter used to say many years ago)
[06/19 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> :D
[06/19 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you Charlie! :)
[06/19 15:20] <02charlie> does anyone have any objection to my creating the reverse change for 6/24 now?

[06/19 16:47] <02charlie> might be interested in this from the RAP meeting. Debbie rececives the meeting minutes, so she'll see this in the meeting minutes: 5.	Business Decisions regarding LN Publisher Steve shared that NARS customers will not be migrating off of the product.  Progress has been made on migrating BIS customers to Newsdesk, and an effort is underway to migrate LN UK customers. If I understood Steve 
[06/19 16:47] <02charlie> correctly in the meeting LN Publisher uses the OLS.
[06/19 16:48] <JimE_zOS> LNP does use the OLS, yes. 
[06/19 16:48] <06Amit_ZOS> i was there in the meeting
[06/19 16:48] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, they wont be migrating customers off of those
[06/19 16:52] <JimE_zOS> of course not
[06/19 16:52] <JimE_zOS> even though the mainframe sux.

[06/20 09:56] <02charlie> when you get a few minutes, jim, got a question from chris nickelman about adding an stask to the standard f-card change
[06/20 09:59] <JimE_zOS> sure
[06/20 09:59] <JimE_zOS> what does he want
[06/20 10:01] <02charlie> he would like an stask for them to check the application is complete for them to close the change
[06/20 10:01] <02charlie> [06/20 08:57] <PSO_Nickelman_UKB> Charlie - if you could add the name of the job to the change.  we can verify that it completed and makes it easier to close.
[06/20 10:01] <02charlie> [06/20 08:59] <charlie> do you want the name of the job or the name of the application?
[06/20 10:02] <02charlie> [06/20 09:28] <PSO_Nickelman_UKB> name of the app?  we can verify the app completed to close the change
[06/20 10:02] <02charlie> [06/20 09:29] <charlie> SE00CRNFCARD
[06/20 10:02] <02charlie> [06/20 09:29] <PSO_Nickelman_UKB> you or 'we' can add that as a CTASK?
[06/20 10:03] <JimE_zOS> I see no reason to do any of that. 
[06/20 10:03] <JimE_zOS> if the app goes into error, OPS will know and cut a ticket from the error list. 
[06/20 10:03] <JimE_zOS> so making changes to the change seem to be work for the sake of work. 
[06/20 10:04] <JimE_zOS> furthermore, that isn't the deal I cut with OPS 
[06/20 10:04] <JimE_zOS> and Chris wasn't part of the OPS mgt discussion. 
[06/20 10:04] <JimE_zOS> so I'm reluctant to goof with the deal I already have. 
[06/20 10:05] <JimE_zOS> plus, Chris N. isn't working the shift where F-Card renames even run. 
[06/20 10:07] <02charlie> i understand all of that, and agree. I think the reason why chris was asking was that this morning when i checked, the f-card change was still in scheduled status
[06/20 10:08] <02charlie> i do think i understand why he'd like the name of the app in the change
[06/20 10:08] <JimE_zOS> k...but that means OPS failed to do their job. 
[06/20 10:09] <JimE_zOS> and I don't see how us adding unneeded information to the change request helps with that. 
[06/20 10:14] <JimE_zOS> and another thing, adding hte name of the application to the change might cause OPS to reach out and goof with teh rename in some way. 
[06/20 10:14] <JimE_zOS> I don't want them to over think their role. 
[06/20 10:14] <JimE_zOS> they are in this chain simply to close the change request.  Nothing more. 
[06/20 10:14] <02charlie> got it, thx

Session Ident: #theRock
[06/20 15:03] * Now talking in #theRock
[06/20 15:03] * Topic is 'Rule#1: Debbie is always right!'
[06/20 15:03] * Set by ChanServ on Fri May 12 11:17:17
[06/20 15:03] * ChanServ sets mode: +o Amit_ZOS
[06/20 15:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, you would have loved the last session there! :D It was right in your alley!
[06/20 15:07] <JimE_zOS>  I should probably go to some of those. 
[06/20 15:08] <JimE_zOS> just so hard to find the time. 
[06/20 15:08] <JimE_zOS> so I limit myself to the RACF User's Group meetings. 
[06/20 15:10] <06Amit_ZOS> The person who was presenting had similar roles like yourself.. he was a developer as well as a security personnel..
[06/20 15:10] <06Amit_ZOS> his opening lines were: "I'm a Z Bigot!
[06/20 15:10] <06Amit_ZOS> "
[06/20 15:11] <06Amit_ZOS> "A session is of no value to me untill i see some JCL and RACF commands"
[06/20 15:11] <JimE_zOS> I'm there. 
[06/20 15:11] <JimE_zOS> wow....I might have to put this guy on my Christmas Card List. :-)
[06/20 15:11] <02charlie> lol
[06/20 15:11] <02charlie> yeah, you would definitely have liked him
[06/20 15:12] <02charlie> he's out of poughkepsie
[06/20 15:12] <JimE_zOS> have a name? 
[06/20 15:13] <02charlie> did you hang onto the agenda, amit?
[06/20 15:13] <02charlie> his name was on that
[06/20 15:13] <06Amit_ZOS> Mark Nelson
[06/20 15:14] <06Amit_ZOS> We'l share the material once we get it and you can go through them when free.. :)
[06/20 15:15] <06Amit_ZOS> i believe they will mail it out to us tomorrow
[06/20 15:15] <JimE_zOS> Mark Nelson.  I've met him. 
[06/20 15:15] <JimE_zOS> it was at a RACF meeting.  
[06/20 15:15] <02charlie> ah, then he's on your xmas card list alreay :)
[06/20 15:16] <02charlie> his topic was pervasive encription
[06/20 15:16] <JimE_zOS> he gave me my "50th year" coin. 
[06/20 15:16] <02charlie> ah
[06/20 15:16] <06Amit_ZOS> nice
[06/20 15:16] <JimE_zOS> he speeks RACF assembler. 
[06/20 15:16] <JimE_zOS> at a level you would not believe. 
[06/20 15:16] <JimE_zOS> much of RACROUTE was coded by Mark. 
[06/20 15:16] <02charlie> yes he does, he even asked how many assembler programmers were in the room
[06/20 15:17] <02charlie> then he talked about R17-80 that arent available at the zos level
[06/20 15:17] <06Amit_ZOS> most of the last session went over my head
[06/20 15:18] <02charlie> and we wouldnt be able to use the pervasive encription on out ols DBs, because we access them thru channel programming
[06/20 15:18] <02charlie> on our
[06/20 15:19] <JimE_zOS> I vote that they are encrypted enough as-is. :-)
[06/20 15:19] <02charlie> you'd need to have access only thru sms interfaces (*sam) to use that
[06/20 15:20] <06Amit_ZOS> i don't quite understand smf's..
[06/20 15:20] <02charlie> although i'd bet there'd be a way to do that thru CP, but they probably dont publish teh interface for that
[06/20 15:48] <JimE_zOS> I think I just agreed that my last day at LN will be Thursday.  I have a skip level with Mark Samuels.  If I say even 10% of what I'm thinking, I'll be fired by COB. 
[06/20 15:48] <02charlie> lol
[06/20 15:49] <JimE_zOS> I'll work on my silent yoga chants during the meeting. 
[06/20 15:49] <JimE_zOS> maybe I can excape with my job. 
[06/20 15:49] <JimE_zOS> escape, even 
[06/20 15:49] <02charlie> you might want to excape :)
[06/20 15:49] <JimE_zOS> I already do. 
[06/20 15:50] <06Amit_ZOS> whats a skip level?
[06/20 15:50] <02charlie> btw, that's certainly skipping a lot of levels
[06/20 15:50] <JimE_zOS> you meet with a layer of management above your direct manager
[06/20 15:50] <JimE_zOS> in this case, Eric's bosses boss. 
[06/20 15:50] <06Amit_ZOS> so a 1 in 1
[06/20 15:51] <JimE_zOS> not exactly. 
[06/20 15:51] <02charlie> does hall report to allen?
[06/20 15:51] <06Amit_ZOS> thats great!
[06/20 15:51] <JimE_zOS> Hall reports to Mark Samuels. 
[06/20 15:51] <02charlie> that's who i meant
[06/20 15:51] <JimE_zOS> it is always a panel discussion, Amit. 
[06/20 15:51] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. ok
[06/20 15:52] <JimE_zOS> so the manager and 10-15 worker bees
[06/20 15:52] <JimE_zOS> that kind of a format. 
[06/20 15:52] <02charlie> i thought he reported to riehle
[06/20 15:52] <02charlie> he=hall
[06/20 15:52] <JimE_zOS> Samuels probably does, Charlie. 
[06/20 15:52] <02charlie> ok, then i'm totally confused
[06/20 15:53] <JimE_zOS> do a walk through the phone book.  
[06/20 15:53] <JimE_zOS> Start with EK, pick the "organization" tab and see what you get. 
[06/20 15:53] <JimE_zOS> then click on Eric's boss (Eric Hall) and do the same. 
[06/20 15:54] <JimE_zOS> etc. 
[06/20 15:54] <JimE_zOS> you'll find: EK -> EK -> Mark Samuels -> Jeff Reihl
[06/20 15:55] <02charlie> -> walsh -> engstrom, who's shares a supervisor with engstrom :)
[06/20 15:56] <02charlie> and i know which EK you meant ;)
[06/20 15:56] <JimE_zOS> yeah, that should have been EK -> EH 
[06/20 15:56] <JimE_zOS> little Eric to big Eric. 
[06/20 15:56] <02charlie> lol
[06/20 17:00] <02charlie> btw, did they fix the a/c jim?
[06/20 17:40] <JimE_zOS> ish. 
[06/20 17:40] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Martha came home and I stepped away
[06/20 17:40] <02charlie> np
[06/20 17:40] <JimE_zOS> certainly better in here now. 
[06/20 17:40] <02charlie> but ot sure?
[06/20 17:40] <JimE_zOS> but the service call is "unresolved".
[06/20 17:40] <02charlie> not
[06/20 17:41] <02charlie> ugh
[06/20 17:41] <02charlie> :(
[06/20 17:41] <02charlie> they coming back tomorrow, or they just dont know what the probem is?
[06/20 17:41] <JimE_zOS> one of those "unable to duplicate customer complaint" type calls. 
[06/20 17:41] <02charlie> oh, nice
[06/20 17:41] <02charlie> well, why dont you schedule them to come back daily until its fixed? :)
[06/20 17:42] <JimE_zOS> want to come back when it is hotter outside. 
[06/20 17:42] <02charlie> as long as they do
[06/20 17:42] <JimE_zOS> because they charge $150.00 everytime they show up. 
[06/20 17:42] <JimE_zOS> and I'm kinda thinking that today was their last visit. 
[06/20 17:42] <02charlie> dont they warrant their ptoduct?
[06/20 17:42] <02charlie> product
[06/20 17:43] <02charlie> its not even been a year yet
[06/20 17:43] <JimE_zOS> they did....but I'm outside the warrenty period now. 
[06/20 17:43] <JimE_zOS> so I thik I'll just find a service company I like better. 
[06/20 17:43] <02charlie> sheesh
[06/20 17:43] <JimE_zOS> now that Martha is here, think I'll step back away. 
[06/20 17:43] <02charlie> i'll give you the name of someone i know who's reliable up there
[06/20 17:44] <JimE_zOS> yell if I can help w/something. 
[06/20 17:44] <02charlie> and so will i. night, jim

[06/21 09:31] <02charlie> just your disconnection
[06/21 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> i disconnected just to kick out amit_away
[06/21 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> plus i was not sure i was actually connected
[06/21 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> and if you had recieved my good morning msg
[06/21 09:34] <02charlie> i had not
[06/21 09:34] <02charlie> until you pasted them back in
[06/21 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. yeah that happens if i was already connected from home and switch connections to office
[06/21 09:35] <02charlie> ah
[06/21 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> question: where do i get yesterdays lcre data?

[06/21 09:36] <02charlie> yes
[06/21 09:37] <02charlie> prod i assume?

[06/21 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks again
[06/21 09:38] <02charlie> sure
[06/21 09:39] <02charlie> it's all in the cheatsheet :)
[06/21 09:39] <02charlie> but since i wrote it, i know where everything is :)
[06/21 09:39] <02charlie> unlike jim, i dont have all these things memorized

[06/21 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. did it in fabc
[06/21 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah..
[06/21 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> but why the 2 tickets with the same issue?
[06/21 09:55] <02charlie> because they put the document back online without fixing it
[06/21 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> oops
[06/21 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/21 09:56] <02charlie> so fabsup needs to re-delete it and then send it to the data owners
[06/21 09:56] <02charlie> "well, the update ran so it must be good" :(
[06/21 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> so the story is the first time you saw it, and raised the ticket, they did something that did not fix it and they put it online.. you tested it and it failed and you had to raise another ticket. Is that it?
[06/21 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/21 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[06/21 09:58] <02charlie> actually, i saw the doc show up in the DW abends yesterday. Since it failed in FABC, i knew it was available in prod, so I created the first ticket. If you notice, that ticket also references an update ticket where that doc caused a failure.
[06/21 10:00] <02charlie> then when it showed up in the prod analysis this morning, i checked the doc again (just in case they had tried before the doc had been temp-deleted by fabsup). Since it failed again in FABC, i SERPRTed the doc to make sure it was actually available, then created the new ticket
[06/21 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> not able to find related records there 
[06/21 10:00] <02charlie> ?
[06/21 10:01] <02charlie> where is there?
[06/21 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> SERPRTed?
[06/21 10:02] <02charlie> the program SERPRT will print documents from the serial file. it also shows the switches, and other information about the document
[06/21 10:02] <02charlie> see ULESTCXP J053300
[06/21 10:02] <06Amit_ZOS> i meant i could not find the update ticket that you raised yesterday
[06/21 10:02] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/21 10:02] <02charlie> this ticket INC01565107 references the update ticket number
[06/21 10:03] <02charlie> i didnt create the update ticket
[06/21 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/21 10:03] <02charlie> but i have learned that when i think i've got a bad doc (and especially when the db# looks familiar) to search SNow for the LNI
[06/21 10:04] <02charlie> that's how i found the update ticket, and why I referenced it
[06/21 10:05] <02charlie> because they have a tendency to "resolve" my ticket to the update ticket, because the update is a sev 3 as opposed to the sev 2 i create
[06/21 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[06/21 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> where did you get the error description from ?
[06/21 10:08] <02charlie> the CREXDD message?
[06/21 10:08] <02charlie> CREXDD/105E iirc
[06/21 10:08] <02charlie> ?
[06/21 10:08] <02charlie> that's a diary message
[06/21 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> in the ticket you said it encoutered an SGML tag
[06/21 10:09] <02charlie> notice the format: db/gen/cur doc #
[06/21 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> The error description is that an error was encountered processing an SGML tag----- this also from diary?
[06/21 10:11] <02charlie> and if you look into the daily spam, you will see:
[06/21 10:11] <02charlie> CREXDD+00080 XXD_AB05 error encountered processing an SGML tag 
[06/21 10:12] <02charlie> which, if you look into the program CREXDD, you will find a label XXD_AB05 that has a description something like "error encountered processing an SGML tag"
[06/21 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> oh..
[06/21 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/21 10:14] <02charlie> the daily spam is actually extracting that (XXD_AB05 error encountered processing an SGML tag) from a file where i have associated "CREXDD+00080" with "XXD_AB05 error encountered processing an SGML tag"
[06/21 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah..

[06/21 10:53] <02charlie> and we're getting a bunch of lxcore abends in cl2 on the related terms dbs
[06/21 10:54] <06Amit_ZOS> can you give me the path where i can find logs in a box?
[06/21 10:54] <06Amit_ZOS> cd /l-n/work...???
[06/21 10:57] <02charlie> which logs, which box?
[06/21 10:58] <06Amit_ZOS> psc1826
[06/21 10:58] <06Amit_ZOS> prod logs
[06/21 10:58] <06Amit_ZOS> im just trying to find more about the LXCORES
[06/21 10:59] <02charlie> i dont think you'll find anything relevant on the ta box
[06/21 10:59] <02charlie> cd /l-n/log/discus/qbrws
[06/21 10:59] <02charlie> cd /l-n/log/discus/qsrch
[06/21 11:08] <02charlie> i think we have a serious problem with cl2, and im not sure why
[06/21 11:13] <02charlie> amit, since you took that sev 2 ticket, you can complete those SE00LSR$UNLOAD jobs in error from 1000
[06/21 11:13] <02charlie> the 1100 runs ran fine
[06/21 11:14] <02charlie> and as jim shared, the change is now complete
[06/21 11:15] <02charlie> i'm running diary windows against 22 and 27, and we're still getting regular abends in those copies (and i would expect, all the other cl2 copies as well)
[06/21 11:21] <02charlie> btw jim, i stole xm from you because you were running an errand
[06/21 11:23] <02charlie> jim, do you think i'm right in suspecting we have a metadata issue with the related terms?
[06/21 11:23] <02charlie> those dbs havent changed in a while, so it's not the dbs
[06/21 11:23] <02charlie> and we're over 3300 abends in cl2 now
[06/21 11:23] <02charlie> started at 0219 on copy 26
[06/21 11:24] <02charlie> bio break
[06/21 11:27] <JimE_zOS> Charlie?  Looking with Amit....wondering about the the dates in Ausm vs catalog dates for these problem bases. 
[06/21 11:27] <JimE_zOS> 8434 and 8435, for example 
[06/21 11:27] <JimE_zOS> they appear in the abline list frequently 
[06/21 11:28] <JimE_zOS> and teh LXCORE RC=8 seems extra weird to me. 
[06/21 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> will do
[06/21 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> @charlie
[06/21 11:28] <JimE_zOS> Metadata could certainly be a problem.  
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> all of these show up:
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> 8432,0008
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> 8434,0011
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> 8435,0011
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> 8436,0010
[06/21 11:28] <02charlie> 8439,0010
[06/21 11:28] <JimE_zOS> it is absolutely on the list of usual suspects
[06/21 11:28] <JimE_zOS> low gens 
[06/21 11:28] <JimE_zOS> I wonder if they are now in a menu and weren't before. 
[06/21 11:29] <02charlie> that's my guess
[06/21 11:29] <JimE_zOS> ie....not ready for prime time but 
[06/21 11:30] <JimE_zOS> then I'd vote dummy doc load to those bases. 
[06/21 11:30] <JimE_zOS> so at least they quiet down
[06/21 11:30] <JimE_zOS> reasonable? 
[06/21 11:30] <02charlie> oow, i think that would hurt
[06/21 11:30] <02charlie> there's something special about those bases
[06/21 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> 1:1 with EK
[06/21 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[06/21 11:31] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/21 11:33] <JimE_zOS> what makes you think the bases are special, Charlie? 
[06/21 11:36] <02charlie> just a recollection of email exchanges with anita/debbie/bobbie
[06/21 11:36] <02charlie> im trying to find something more specific now
[06/21 11:36] <JimE_zOS> I don't know why they would be special and be finding their way into a menu just today. 
[06/21 11:36] <JimE_zOS> those things would appear to be conflicting. 
[06/21 11:41] <02charlie> well, i asked bobbie and copied brian
[06/21 11:42] <02charlie> and the devs
[06/21 11:44] <02charlie> ah, anita remembered by they were special: When we restored the ones we lost, we tested in SPCE for  about a month before giving the go-ahead.
[06/21 11:45] <02charlie> why not by
[06/21 11:45] <02charlie> ok, i've got to take my bio break which never happened
[06/21 11:50] <JimE_zOS> that does sound special. 
[06/21 11:50] <JimE_zOS> K....I'll drop the "rebuild/reload" idea. 
[06/21 11:51] <02charlie> :)
[06/21 11:51] <02charlie> maybe we can just "lose" them again ;)
[06/21 11:52] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee.  BRB 
[06/21 11:52] <Amit_away> isn't it possible to revert the database to how it was yesterday?
[06/21 11:52] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/21 11:52] <06Amit_zOS> b btw
[06/21 11:52] <02charlie> it's not the db that's the problem. it hasnt changed in years
[06/21 11:53] <02charlie> what we'd need to do is a metadata backout
[06/21 11:53] <02charlie> which i'm inclined to suggest, painful tho it is
[06/21 11:58] <02charlie> not the smartest search in the world: KEY-TERMS-ALL ("CASE LAW" OR "REFERENCE" OR "BY" OR "COURT")    
[06/21 12:05] <JimE_zOS> sorry....back....talking to Amit. 
[06/21 12:05] <JimE_zOS> we were just talking about metadata backout, Charlie. 
[06/21 12:06] <JimE_zOS> can be done, of course, but there are likely to be unintended consequences 
[06/21 12:06] <02charlie> what's worse?
[06/21 12:06] <JimE_zOS> 10 hours of updates where metadata is baked into new gens
[06/21 12:06] <JimE_zOS> so we could have 100's of new problems. 
[06/21 12:06] <02charlie> great
[06/21 12:07] <JimE_zOS> my line in the sand has always been noon-ish. 
[06/21 12:07] <02charlie> well, we're past the noon point
[06/21 12:07] <JimE_zOS> if the metadata backout isn't done by noon, I'm reluctant to start it. 
[06/21 12:07] <JimE_zOS> we didn't even notice the problem until 11am. 
[06/21 12:07] <JimE_zOS> so I'm not sure a backout is in our best interests. 
[06/21 12:07] <JimE_zOS> assuming, of course, that Bobbi has something that will make this better at 02:00 
[06/21 12:08] <JimE_zOS> if not, we'll need to rethink 
[06/21 12:10] <JimE_zOS> Bobbi's note doesn't seem to have a smoking gun, does it? 
[06/21 12:10] <JimE_zOS> nor the promise of a 2am fix. 
[06/21 12:11] <02charlie> no, but something changed. there wasnt a release last night of any type
[06/21 12:11] <02charlie> im going to paw thru the change records from yesterday and today to see if there's anything there 
[06/21 12:14] <02charlie> bobbie does her testing in fabc for the metadata, right?
[06/21 12:14] <JimE_zOS> yes, true. 
[06/21 12:20] <02charlie> would the storage change possibly have any effect on the dbs?
[06/21 12:21] <02charlie> i hate to be one of those people, but do you think a bounce of the sr might help it?
[06/21 12:22] <06Amit_zOS> if the problem is with the databases, would bouncing the SR's help?
[06/21 12:22] <JimE_zOS> the tape change shouldn't have any impact at all. 
[06/21 12:22] <02charlie> i agree amit, it wouldnt
[06/21 12:23] <JimE_zOS> if the DB is at fault....what you both said. 
[06/21 12:23] <JimE_zOS> it can't hurt, Charlie (the bounce, that is)
[06/21 12:23] <02charlie> and i'm ooking on the volumes and there are too many other dbs on those, so i dont think that will solve it
[06/21 12:24] <06Amit_zOS> And anita said there were no such abends yesterday even in fabc right?
[06/21 12:24] <JimE_zOS> maybe/if.  Since we have LXCORE'ed our brains out, a bounce might correct any core corruption 
[06/21 12:24] <02charlie> but there are today when she does related terms
[06/21 12:25] <02charlie> but the abends i'm seeing in my monitor window are still the ones on just those dbs
[06/21 12:26] <02charlie> so if you'd like to try it, i will ask ops, but we havent had any warmstarts either afaict
[06/21 12:32] <06Amit_zOS> an LXCORE in 8434 is always accompanied by SNCTRL on 8435
[06/21 12:33] <02charlie> yes, the LXCOREs and the SNCTRLs are paired
[06/21 12:33] <02charlie> oh, bobbie, that makes my head hurt :-|
[06/21 12:36] <06Amit_zOS> would you like me to make the c1 fcard change guys?
[06/21 12:36] <02charlie> sure
[06/21 12:36] <06Amit_zOS> no need for a change request there right?
[06/21 12:36] <02charlie> correct
[06/21 12:36] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/21 12:43] <02charlie> i dont see any related changes 
[06/21 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> made the change in C$170621
[06/21 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> NZ00.SS.CONFIG.FCARDS.C1(C$170621)
[06/21 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> shall i submit it?
[06/21 12:44] <02charlie> the only change anyway related to cl2 seems to be CHG0158415 Mainframe database move - address issue reported in INC01539118 for DB J013.
[06/21 12:45] <02charlie> that's a cl2 database
[06/21 12:45] <02charlie> yes, please
[06/21 12:46] <02charlie> XMLOPC: This is a chained database product and all secondary databases must exist on the same staging device. 
[06/21 12:46] <02charlie> XMLOPC: For this product, all secondary databases must exist on node "2". 
[06/21 12:46] <02charlie> XMLOPC: Secondary database "J013" however exists on node "1".
[06/21 12:46] <02charlie> but i dont see how that might cause an issue
[06/21 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> how does the SR reference databases? by their name? like 'J013' or is there some sort of serial number indexing to them?
[06/21 12:54] <02charlie> well it looks at all the volumes on the drives it knows about, finds all the datasets on the volumes that match the patterns in the f-cards, and so it will find:
[06/21 12:54] <02charlie> PL00.LPA4C.D008432.G0008.S000001
[06/21 12:54] <02charlie> PL00.LPA4C.D008432.G0008.S010101
[06/21 12:54] <02charlie> PL00.LPA4C.D008432.G0008.S020101
[06/21 12:58] <06Amit_zOS> so if the insertion of J013 would change how 8434 would be addressed.... 
[06/21 12:58] <06Amit_zOS> BTW, fcards prepped

[06/21 12:59] <02charlie> not sure what you're asking
[06/21 12:59] <02charlie> i fixed the history record
[06/21 12:59] <02charlie> thx
[06/21 13:00] <06Amit_zOS> oh, had i not changed the member name?
[06/21 13:00] <02charlie> correct
[06/21 13:00] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[06/21 13:04] <06Amit_zOS> the last one we did was in March, i don't recollect, did we have an application to schedule for C1?
[06/21 13:04] <02charlie> no, c1 just picks up the current cards
[06/21 13:04] <06Amit_zOS> thought so
[06/21 13:04] <06Amit_zOS> thanks
[06/21 13:04] <06Amit_zOS>  :)
[06/21 13:07] <06Amit_zOS> so if J013 was moved to cl2, would it be named something like this?  PL00.LPA4C.D00J013.G0xxx.S000xxx?
[06/21 13:13] <02charlie> the mask PL00.LPA4C.D00J013 should bring it up in 3.4
[06/21 13:44] <06Amit_zOS> off for lunch..
[06/21 13:44] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[06/21 13:44] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/21 13:49] <02charlie> btw, matt bounced copy 22, it didnt affect the abends
[06/21 13:57] <02charlie> does this look at all odd?
[06/21 13:57] <02charlie>    DATASET NAME                              VOLSER   CREDT     REFDT

[06/21 13:59] <02charlie> the last one is different from all the rest
[06/21 14:09] <JimE_zOS> it did to me when I looked this morning, Charlie. 
[06/21 14:09] <JimE_zOS> which prompted me to look in AUSM. 
[06/21 14:10] <02charlie> i dint think that's the issue, just another anamoly
[06/21 14:10] <JimE_zOS> and none of hte create dates match AUSM. 
[06/21 14:10] <JimE_zOS> so I'm guessing the base was moved at some point. 
[06/21 14:10] <02charlie> well, the lost them and had to restore them from backup copies
[06/21 14:10] <02charlie> they
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> where do we get our menu information for the OLS? 
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> is see these 2 cards:
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=ROSETA 
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=WS0BA2 
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=WS0LX0 
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=GALEG  
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=WSCO4F 
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> 2 MENU=TNLEG  
[06/21 14:15] <02charlie> ah,  F SYSMNLEX        PL00.PROD1.PROD.CL00.METADATA.MNU   
[06/21 14:16] <02charlie> and the bridge copy F SYSMNLEX        PL00.BRDG1.PROD.CL08.METADATA.MNU 
[06/21 14:18] <02charlie> can we get rid of these jim?
[06/21 14:18] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.FAIL.CL00.METADATA.MNU*
[06/21 14:18] <02charlie> i think these were created 4/27 when we did our metadata backout
[06/21 14:19] <JimE_zOS> the FAIL datasets?  Sure....those can go. 
[06/21 14:20] <02charlie> for anita, i will copy PL00.PROD1.PAST.CL00.METADATA.MNU      
[06/21 14:20] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.PAST.CL00.METADATA.MNU.DEF  
[06/21 14:20] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.PAST.CL00.METADATA.MNU.FLS  
[06/21 14:20] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.PAST.CL00.METADATA.MNU.LIB   to the FAIL datasets (since ther're already there and allocated)
[06/21 14:20] <02charlie> and then put them where she can get to them
[06/21 14:21] <JimE_zOS> there is a batch version. 
[06/21 14:21] <JimE_zOS> so why do you need to copy them? 
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PROD.METADATA.MNU            
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PROD.METADATA.MNU.DEF        
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PROD.METADATA.MNU.FLS        
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PROD.METADATA.MNU.LIB        
[06/21 14:22] <02charlie> anita's trying to get yesterday's version to use in her test system to see if the problem goes away
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> which exist everywhere in producdtino. 
[06/21 14:22] <JimE_zOS> then run against PI00.PAST.METADATA.MNU etc. 
[06/21 14:22] <02charlie> great
[06/21 14:22] <02charlie> thx
[06/21 14:23] <JimE_zOS> but she'll need an OLS name. 
[06/21 14:23] <JimE_zOS> and an "L" volume. 
[06/21 14:23] <JimE_zOS> but she can do that herself, I guess. 
[06/21 14:23] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PAST.METADATA will get her close. 
[06/21 14:23] <JimE_zOS> and that is much better than goofing with OLS datasets. 
[06/21 14:33] <JimE_zOS> not that it helps much, but I've duped the Cluster 2 monitoring tickets to INC01567621.  The resolver of that ticket will get credit for all. 
[06/21 14:34] <02charlie> thank you, jim. they've stopped the autoticketing for that, that will help too 
[06/21 14:46] <02charlie> so PL00.LPASA.DBD[1|2] is not a batch copy of production DBD in PROD, but the OLS copy, am I correct?
[06/21 14:52] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/21 14:55] <JimE_zOS> it is the LIVE OLS copy, yes, true. 
[06/21 14:56] <02charlie> so what's the difference between, say, PL00.LPASA.DBD1 and PL00.LPASA.CL00.METADATA.DBD1?
[06/21 14:58] <JimE_zOS> one of my baby steps toward making OLS metadata DSNs more uniform and (therefore) improving the chances of automated fallback. 
[06/21 14:58] <JimE_zOS> I'd have to look at the F-Cards to know for sure. 
[06/21 14:58] <02charlie> F SYSDBD1         PL00.LPASA.CL00.METADATA.DBD1 
[06/21 14:58] <02charlie> and
[06/21 14:58] <JimE_zOS> but you are probably right....the datasets on the LM09* volume is hte live dataset
[06/21 14:59] <02charlie> and No CHARS 'PL00.LPASA.DBD
[06/21 14:59] <JimE_zOS> but teh first datasets you mention are teh version that MAS/DAS updates. 
[06/21 14:59] <JimE_zOS> yeah...that still matters to the flow. 
[06/21 15:00] <JimE_zOS> maybe not to the OLS directly, but to metadata flow in general. 
[06/21 15:00] <02charlie> ah, ok, that would make my notes make sense
[06/21 15:01] <02charlie> and we brobably somewhere along the way convert/copy PL00.LPASA.DBD1 -> PL00.LPASA.CL00.METADATA.DBD1
[06/21 15:01] <JimE_zOS> and, BTW, it is PL00.LPASA.DBD* 
[06/21 15:01] <02charlie> ah no wonder
[06/21 15:01] <JimE_zOS> you need that * (or an %) to find those datasets. 
[06/21 15:01] <02charlie> yep
[06/21 15:01] <JimE_zOS> running to 1:1 
[06/21 15:02] <JimE_zOS> Back as soon as I can. 
[06/21 15:02] <02charlie> PZ00.SS.CONFIG.FCARDS.PROD(P$170620) - 01.00       No CHARS 'PL00.LPASA.DBD
[06/21 15:02] <02charlie> and I'm using  f PL00.LPASA.DBD*
[06/21 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> some confusing stuff there
[06/21 15:06] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/21 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> that was shorT!
[06/21 15:06] <02charlie> here are the SYSDBD1 masks in the f-cards: PL00.LPASA.CL0[0|1|2|3|4|8].METADATA.DBD1 and PL00.BRDG1.PROD.CL08.METADATA.DB1
[06/21 15:07] <JimE_zOS> didn't I say above that the OLS doesn't use those datasets?  They are for metadata flow reasons. 
[06/21 15:07] <02charlie> ah, i thought you were saying they were in the fcards
[06/21 15:07] <JimE_zOS> no....not 
[06/21 15:07] <02charlie> i misunderstood
[06/21 15:08] <JimE_zOS> but if you delete them, really bad things will happen during metadata prep 
[06/21 15:08] <02charlie> oh, yeah. i dont like deleting any pl00 dataset
[06/21 15:08] <02charlie> that's why i asked about the FAIL ones
[06/21 15:10] <JimE_zOS> FAIL datasets are free. :-)
[06/21 15:14] <02charlie> ok, i am deleting the following datasets
[06/21 15:14] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.FAIL.CL00.METADATA.MNU    
[06/21 15:14] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.FAIL.CL00.METADATA.MNU.DEF
[06/21 15:14] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.FAIL.CL00.METADATA.MNU.FLS
[06/21 15:14] <02charlie> PL00.PROD1.FAIL.CL00.METADATA.MNU.LIB
[06/21 15:15] <02charlie> and this PL00.PROD1.BKUP.CL00.METADATA.MNU is a copy of this PL00.PROD1.PROD.CL00.METADATA.MNU, correct?
[06/21 15:16] <02charlie> and i have a favor to ask jim
[06/21 15:16] <JimE_zOS> it is the hot spare copy, yes, Charlie. 
[06/21 15:17] <02charlie> thats what i thought
[06/21 15:17] <02charlie> cool
[06/21 15:17] <JimE_zOS> Amit?  Are you OK with the monitor unload fix? 
[06/21 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> Umm, I completed that from the error list if thats what you mean
[06/21 15:19] <JimE_zOS> so you did.  Nevermind 
[06/21 15:19] <02charlie> did you close the ticket?
[06/21 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> no
[06/21 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> will do now
[06/21 15:20] <JimE_zOS> I'm in a glass house on closing tickets. 
[06/21 15:20] <JimE_zOS> so I refuse to cast teh first stone. 
[06/21 15:20] <02charlie> lol
[06/21 15:20] <02charlie> so am i, if you notice :)
[06/21 15:21] <JimE_zOS> so hard to look past my failing that I really don't look for others. 
[06/21 15:26] <JimE_zOS> oh, sorry, Charlie....missed it.  What favor can I do for you? 
[06/21 15:28] <02charlie> my son called and wanted to take me to dinner and a movie tonight for fathers day. Would you mind taking xm until i get back, and then i wont bother you on sunday? I hate to do it with all the abends we've been getting today, but I dont think anything will go off the rails while i'm out, and i'll take it back when i get back in
[06/21 15:29] <JimE_zOS> sure...happy to cover. 
[06/21 15:29] <02charlie> thx
[06/21 15:29] <02charlie> i can throw you in when he gets here about 1730-1800, and then put mysef back in when i get back
[06/21 15:31] <06Amit_zOS> its closed
[06/21 15:32] <06Amit_zOS> which movie Charlie!?
[06/21 15:32] <02charlie> gotg
[06/21 15:33] <JimE_zOS> sure....put me in what you like and remove me when no longer needed. 
[06/21 15:33] <JimE_zOS> certainly works for me
[06/21 15:33] <02charlie> sure
[06/21 15:33] <02charlie> thx
[06/21 15:34] <02charlie> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/
[06/21 15:36] <06Amit_zOS> its a nice movie :)
[06/21 15:37] <06Amit_zOS> the first edition certainly was
[06/21 15:44] <02charlie> i think our abends are slowing down
[06/21 15:44] <02charlie> we're going minutes between them con copy 22 and 27
[06/21 15:44] <02charlie> on, not con
[06/21 15:45] <02charlie> copy 27 is trying to prove me wrong
[06/21 16:16] <JimE_zOS> note in your inbox, Charlie (and Amit) 
[06/21 16:17] <JimE_zOS> we are working toward rename cancellation for tonight.
[06/21 16:17] <JimE_zOS> and I'm working on a FABC SR DBD fallback 
[06/21 16:18] <02charlie> i like the idea of working in fabc for some fallback options
[06/21 16:18] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/21 16:18] <02charlie> and totally agree with the metadata cancellation
[06/21 16:20] <02charlie> should we take one of our current tciekts and make it a sev 2 for the cancellation, or wait for bobbie to send us one?
[06/21 16:26] <02charlie> amit have you done a metadata cancellation before?
[06/21 16:26] <06Amit_zOS> yes i have
[06/21 16:26] <02charlie> i dont see any reason why you shouldnt start creating the change
[06/21 16:27] <06Amit_zOS> oh well
[06/21 16:27] <06Amit_zOS> will do now
[06/21 16:28] <06Amit_zOS> so we dont need to wait for Bobbie's reply do we?
[06/21 16:29] <02charlie> i would create the paperwork, but not delete the applications until we hear back from somoeone
[06/21 16:30] <02charlie> i'm sure we will do the cancellation, the question is to which incident ticket should it be related
[06/21 16:30] <06Amit_zOS> metadata cancellation = critical rename cancellation right?
[06/21 16:30] <02charlie> yes
[06/21 16:30] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/21 16:33] <06Amit_zOS> CHG0158568
[06/21 16:35] <02charlie> there it is
[06/21 16:36] <02charlie> ok, that's the ticket number for the change INC01567988
[06/21 16:36] <06Amit_zOS> got the page
[06/21 16:36] <02charlie> i'll fix up the paperwork, do you want to do the opc stuff?
[06/21 16:36] <JimE_zOS> k...FABC SRs ready 
[06/21 16:37] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[06/21 16:37] <06Amit_zOS> doing
[06/21 16:40] <02charlie> jim does the metadata change supposed to be done by prod support?
[06/21 16:41] <02charlie> right now the group is ZOS Systems Support - L2/L3 Classic (RETS)
[06/21 16:42] <02charlie> that may have happened because the incident ticket is ours and i associated the two
[06/21 16:44] <02charlie> jim does the metadata change supposed to be done by prod support? ==> i.e., are they supposed to "implement" and close the change?
[06/21 16:44] <06Amit_zOS> metadat change is still us i believe
[06/21 16:44] <06Amit_zOS> just the fcards is them
[06/21 16:45] <02charlie> ah, thx
[06/21 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> and Charlie, all the opc stuff is done.. care to verify?
[06/21 16:46] <02charlie> checking
[06/21 16:47] <06Amit_zOS> shall i do the live feed thing for the change?
[06/21 16:49] <02charlie> yes
[06/21 16:50] <02charlie> and the opc looks good
[06/21 16:50] <02charlie> thank you
[06/21 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> done
[06/21 16:52] <06Amit_zOS> they will set it to implement and i will close this out tomorrow morning
[06/21 16:52] <02charlie> excellent, thx
[06/21 16:56] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[06/21 16:57] <02charlie> thx for your help today, sorry if i was a bit slow or short in responding to you today
[06/21 16:59] <06Amit_zOS> Oh thats cool... I know, its been a rough day for the DBD's
[06/21 16:59] <06Amit_zOS> :P
[06/21 16:59] <06Amit_zOS> allright guys, im heading out..
[06/21 16:59] <02charlie> bye and thx amit
[06/21 17:09] <JimE_zOS> they aren't, Charlie, no. 
[06/21 17:10] <02charlie> ah, i had to remember what my question was :)
[06/21 17:10] <02charlie> thx

[06/21 23:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/21 23:10] <Charlie_merely_lurking> they're not spewing out abends they way they were before we bounced things around 1900
[06/21 23:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/21 23:12] <Charlie_merely_lurking> so i actually like the way the SRs are behaving better than i did before 1900
[06/21 23:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/21 23:13] <zOS_Haas> Is there a way to turn off the VIE-related messages?  Is that something we shouldn't consider?
[06/21 23:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/21 23:14] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i would be up for turning them off (in AP) for tonight and probably tomorrow until the underlying metadata issues get fixed, but i cantdo much with them on out end
[06/21 23:17] <JimE_zOS> I'm guessing for longer than that, Charlie. 
[06/21 23:17] <JimE_zOS> the problem isn't understood at all. 
[06/21 23:18] <Charlie_merely_lurking> you're probably right
[06/21 23:19] <06Amit_ZOS> and since we cancelled renames, the SR's will still be using previous metadata(yesterdays) even after 2 am right?
[06/21 23:20] <JimE_zOS> yes, Amit, true
[06/21 23:21] <06Amit_ZOS> I will leave you guys to do what you guys do best, in case of any help needed with diary checkouts, im here..
[06/21 23:21] <Charlie_merely_lurking> you're welcome to watch #dcops
[06/21 23:22] <06Amit_ZOS> i already am
[06/21 23:29] <JimE_zOS> I'll ask here....
[06/21 23:29] <JimE_zOS> so what happens if we CLOSE the problem bases, Charlie. 
[06/21 23:29] <JimE_zOS> CLOSE as in IDC DBMT. 
[06/21 23:30] <Charlie_merely_lurking> let me read bobbie's comment again
[06/21 23:32] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i would think that should stop the messages. of course, once we hit 0200, we'd have to do it all over again, right?
[06/21 23:32] <Charlie_merely_lurking> we could try it wth one
[06/21 23:32] <Charlie_merely_lurking> but let me check another thing
[06/21 23:33] <JimE_zOS> don't think so.  CLOSEd is CLOSEd. 
[06/21 23:33] <JimE_zOS> that transends EOD 
[06/21 23:33] <Charlie_merely_lurking> oh, ok
[06/21 23:34] <Charlie_merely_lurking> well, 0BOF 0001 is one that has been showing up in cl2
[06/21 23:34] <JimE_zOS> I think I'm going to try closing that base. 
[06/21 23:34] <Charlie_merely_lurking> ok

[06/21 23:57] <Charlie_merely_lurking> serach youtube for sorry charlie and starkist
[06/21 23:58] <Charlie_merely_lurking> how do you look at the xcf vtoc structure?
Session Time: Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 2017
[06/22 00:04] <JimE_zOS> I'm looking at a C1 job I wrote that dumps, compares and updates the VTOC structure.

[06/22 00:17] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I re-opened 0b0f just so we don't forget it is closed and make a new problem later. 
[06/22 00:18] <02charlie> ah, thx, i was going to ask about that
[06/22 00:19] <02charlie> interesting that we had a few earlier i the day also:

[06/22 00:23] <02charlie> but the vast majority cae out after 1900
[06/22 00:34] <02charlie> jim, i dont think you need to stick around at this point
[06/22 00:34] <02charlie> thx for your help!
[06/22 00:40] <JimE_zOS> k, Charlie. 
[06/22 00:40] <JimE_zOS> yell, please, if I can help with something. 
[06/22 00:40] <02charlie> i will, and thx again
[06/22 00:41] <JimE_zOS> sure! 
[06/22 00:48] <02charlie> [06/22 00:46] <zOS_Haas> Are we considering this a permanent change, or should I make a note to back it out at some point?
[06/22 00:48] <02charlie> [06/22 00:47] <zOS_Haas> (after coordinating with you, of course)
[06/22 00:48] <02charlie> [06/22 00:47] <charlie> i'll discuss it with the team, but i'm thinking we'd like to back it out once the underlying metadata issues are resolved. As jim pointed out to me, those are not fully understood, and so my comment earlier "[06/21 23:14] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i would be up for turning them off (in AP) for tonight and probably tomorrow until the underlying metadata issues get fixed" 
[06/22 00:48] <02charlie> is probably a bit optimistic
[06/22 00:55] <02charlie> and yes, amit, to finally answer your question, i plan to run diaries after SOD

[06/22 11:47] <02charlie> back
[06/22 11:57] <02charlie> jim, when he says console messages, is he really saying the HCM of the diary messages?
[06/22 11:57] <JimE_zOS> no, I think he really means MVS console. 
[06/22 11:58] <02charlie> syslog then?
[06/22 11:58] <JimE_zOS> yes. 
[06/22 11:58] <02charlie> ah
[06/22 11:59] <JimE_zOS> I'm thinking the fix for all of these messages is to rename the Gen 1 datasets to some non-OLS name 
[06/22 11:59] <02charlie> yeah, that would do it
[06/22 12:00] <02charlie> can we do that in batch, or the the ols have a hold on them that would prevent that?
[06/22 12:00] <02charlie> or does the
[06/22 12:01] <JimE_zOS> OLS doesn't have a hold on them so we can rename at will 
[06/22 12:01] <02charlie> good
[06/22 12:01] <JimE_zOS> I was just going to do it by hand. 
[06/22 12:01] <02charlie> ugh
[06/22 12:02] <JimE_zOS> not that big a deal. 
[06/22 12:02] <JimE_zOS> and less error prone to go base at a time. 
[06/22 12:02] <JimE_zOS> I'll do it....starting in Cluster 2 
[06/22 12:02] <02charlie> ok, i'll take cluster 1
[06/22 12:02] <02charlie> what names do you want to use?
[06/22 12:03] <06Amit_ZOS> can i be of any help?
[06/22 12:03] <JimE_zOS> I think I'm going to change just the HLQ, Charlie. 
[06/22 12:04] <JimE_zOS> how about PL00 -> PZ01 
[06/22 12:04] <JimE_zOS> easy to find later 
[06/22 12:04] <02charlie> works for me
[06/22 12:04] <JimE_zOS> and, yes, Amit, you can. 
[06/22 12:04] <06Amit_ZOS> what can i do?
[06/22 12:04] <02charlie> do you want to work from an established list, or just do all gen 0001
[06/22 12:04] <02charlie> i would suggest the former
[06/22 12:04] <JimE_zOS> established list. 
[06/22 12:04] <02charlie> ok
[06/22 12:05] <JimE_zOS> just what gets the DBDINDEX failure message
[06/22 12:05] <02charlie> you can probably grab my STAGED.ULESTCX.CL* datsests that say "PROD" to get all the errors up to 0745
[06/22 12:06] <02charlie> which whould be close enough i think
[06/22 12:06] <02charlie> to get all the relevant datasets
[06/22 12:06] <JimE_zOS> using a list I gathered yesterday. 
[06/22 12:06] <02charlie> ah, ok
[06/22 12:06] <JimE_zOS> then I'll look for new friends. 
[06/22 12:07] <JimE_zOS> Amit, I'll walk over and show you what to do. 
[06/22 12:07] <02charlie> btw, i will not be on campus today
[06/22 12:07] <06Amit_ZOS> i can come down
[06/22 12:07] <JimE_zOS> k...that's fine too. 
[06/22 12:07] <06Amit_ZOS> so that you dont have to get up
[06/22 12:07] <JimE_zOS> Sure, Charlie....don't blame you. 
[06/22 12:07] <06Amit_ZOS> on my way
[06/22 12:07] <JimE_zOS> long night.

[06/22 12:25] <JimE_zOS> I don't understand, Charlie. 
[06/22 12:25] <JimE_zOS> the list of bases that the cluster 3 copies listed yesterday as not being in the DBDINDEX are NOT the same bases that he complains about today. 
[06/22 12:26] <JimE_zOS> subset of yesterday's list, actually
[06/22 12:26] <02charlie> hmm
[06/22 12:26] <02charlie> ah, im guessing bobbie's automated process is still adding bases
[06/22 12:27] <02charlie> wait
[06/22 12:27] <02charlie>  today is a subset of yesterday, or vice versa?
[06/22 12:34] <JimE_zOS> thinking....and talking to Amit. 
[06/22 12:34] <JimE_zOS> sec. 
[06/22 12:34] <JimE_zOS> today's metadata is a subset of yesterday's.
[06/22 12:34] <02charlie> i think ive finished cluster 1
[06/22 12:35] <JimE_zOS> so the number of DBDINDEX errors should be teh same as our post DBD fallback errors, true? 
[06/22 12:35] <02charlie> yes
[06/22 12:36] <JimE_zOS> but they aren't. 
[06/22 12:36] <JimE_zOS> in Cluster 3, I see only two messages today where I had 13 yesterday (post DBD fallback)

[06/22 12:40] <JimE_zOS> which seems to match my list from yesterday
[06/22 12:40] <JimE_zOS> but that isn't the list I get from copy 30, for example 
[06/22 12:41] <02charlie> hmm, i dont see any form copy 30 :(
[06/22 12:41] <02charlie> from
[06/22 12:41] <JimE_zOS> and your list is missing DB 1BXD which was an issue yesterday 
[06/22 12:42] <JimE_zOS> I don't get why the lists are different. 
[06/22 12:42] <02charlie> my unloaded diaries shows those messages only for 32, 33, 37, 38
[06/22 12:42] <JimE_zOS> for something as fundamental as being or not being in the DBD 
[06/22 12:43] <02charlie> and my current (well as of 745) diaries show c1, c6, 32, 33, 37, and 38
[06/22 12:44] <JimE_zOS> so why the difference in behavior? 
[06/22 12:44] <02charlie> hmm and in copy 30 i see instead:
[06/22 12:45] <02charlie> eg

[06/22 12:45] <JimE_zOS> right....just those two bases. 
[06/22 12:46] <02charlie> no, there's more, i just showed those two
[06/22 12:46] <02charlie> let me count how many
[06/22 12:46] <02charlie> 13
[06/22 12:47] <02charlie> and they appear to be the same ones listed in the copy c1 messages
[06/22 12:48] <02charlie> and btw, my eyeball of the copy 12 diaries seem to show the renames there stopped the messages
[06/22 12:49] <JimE_zOS> I continue not to understand, but I guess we'll do the renames anyway 
[06/22 12:49] <JimE_zOS> easy enough to undo later, if needed. 
[06/22 12:50] <02charlie> sure, i will move to cluster 4
[06/22 13:01] <02charlie> done with cl 4 i think
[06/22 13:04] <Amit_away> done with cluster 3

[06/22 14:21] <06Amit_ZOS> i was here the whole time
[06/22 14:21] <02charlie> oh, jim, brian briggs just said:
[06/22 14:21] <02charlie> [6/22/2017 2:21 PM] Briggs, Brian C (LNG-DAY): 
[06/22 14:21] <02charlie> We have to worry about coupling facility entries as well. CF entries will be removed tomorrow morning.... I'm going to forward to Ivan /Mark Herby so they can help on catalogue entries. If you need me renaming or working with these please page me or call my work cell 937/674-0152... I know you have been spending many hours on this and I'm not trying to make your life harder :)
[06/22 14:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh ok
[06/22 14:24] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim's not back from the meeting yet i think
[06/22 14:24] <02charlie> ok
[06/22 14:24] <02charlie> well, he'll see it
[06/22 14:24] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/22 14:24] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, i can help with renaming as well

[06/22 14:26] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/22 14:32] <JimE_zOS> why do we need help with catalog entries? 
[06/22 14:57] <JimE_zOS> Wayne has found the issue, Charlie.  It is in the DBD build. 
[06/22 14:57] <02charlie> nice
[06/22 14:58] <JimE_zOS> has to do with a bad match on FKB number
[06/22 14:58] <02charlie> so how long has that been around?
[06/22 14:58] <JimE_zOS> forever. 
[06/22 14:58] <02charlie> sheesh
[06/22 14:59] <02charlie> i think brian had two concerns (1) fabsup normally does the renames of the DBs, so they cant help with the PZ01 ones, and (2) he was concrened our renames might have CF implications
[06/22 15:02] <JimE_zOS> it won't hurt the CF at all and he has no authority to PZ00 or PZ01 
[06/22 15:02] <JimE_zOS> Brian forgets that he owns the data, but we own the OLS. 
[06/22 15:03] <02charlie> right (re authority), which is why he cant help with the PZ01s
[06/22 15:03] <JimE_zOS> per Wayne's request, bouncing FABC SRs
[06/22 15:05] <Amit_away> lol

[06/22 21:50] <06Amit_ZOS> DW LFD was starving for a monitor file was it? thats why we got ticketed?
[06/22 21:51] <Charlie_merely_lurking> and the two lfds crashed as a result
[06/22 21:52] <06Amit_ZOS> ah i see... were'nt the monitor unload app running in DW? or is it that it just got filled up too fast ?
[06/22 21:52] <Charlie_merely_lurking> dw is a pig and used it all up too fast
[06/22 21:53] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah.. unloads run every hour on DW too right?
[06/22 21:53] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yep
[06/22 21:53] <06Amit_ZOS> so the system must have self recovered then
[06/22 21:54] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[06/22 21:54] <Charlie_merely_lurking> actually, dw unloads everh half hour, eg
[06/22 21:54] <Charlie_merely_lurking> SE881MON$UNLOAD   DW Monitor Unload         17/06/22 16.00  C   9  N

[06/22 21:55] <Charlie_merely_lurking> but about 4 minutes before it was to unload, they filled up, and the two lfds crashed
[06/22 21:55] <Charlie_merely_lurking> so we had to restart them
[06/22 21:57] <06Amit_ZOS> i see.. 
[06/22 21:58] <06Amit_ZOS> we could run the monitor unloads manually too if heavy traffic persists right>
[06/22 21:58] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[06/22 21:59] <06Amit_ZOS> Although, in this case, im guessing, you didn't have to do anything ?
[06/22 21:59] <Charlie_merely_lurking> exactly
[06/22 21:59] <Charlie_merely_lurking> just restart the lfds
[06/22 21:59] <06Amit_ZOS> don't they do that themselves?
[06/22 21:59] <Charlie_merely_lurking> no
[06/22 21:59] <06Amit_ZOS> ah
[06/22 22:00] <06Amit_ZOS> i don't know how to restart an lfd
[06/22 22:00] <06Amit_ZOS> SR's if they crash, they restart automatically right?
[06/22 22:00] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/22 17:36] <JimE_zOS> STCJ 180 Start DWFD80J___________ DWFD80J_  1 00.05.43 Y N     Y  0  0 _ E

[06/22 22:00] <Charlie_merely_lurking> [06/22 17:37] <JimE_zOS> so let's change those from "E" status to "R" status. 
[06/22 22:01] <Charlie_merely_lurking> if they warmstart
[06/22 22:01] <Charlie_merely_lurking> if they just abend with, say, a U079, then we would need to restart them

[06/22 22:03] <Charlie_merely_lurking> took me more than an hour just to write it so that it would make sense to anyone reading it later

[06/23 09:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Charlie! :)
[06/23 09:24] <06Amit_ZOS> its raining very heavily here

[06/23 09:35] <triveni> Charlie.. so before applying the fall back in production
[06/23 09:35] <triveni> we tested that in fabc its working fine
[06/23 09:35] <triveni> after that we used the prior dbds?
[06/23 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/23 09:44] <triveni> ok
[06/23 09:45] <triveni> Amit send me the logs of previous days please.
[06/23 09:45] <triveni> and Good morning :))
[06/23 09:50] <02charlie> yes, sorry triveni, i was chasing something
[06/23 09:51] <02charlie> yes, especially with metadata and this goofy kind of fallback we did, we need to check that what we're going to do is not going to break something worse than the original issue
[06/23 09:51] <triveni> ok charlie..
[06/23 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> would we be renaming the PZ01 datasets back to PL01 only after the fix is put into prod SR's?
[06/23 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> *PL00
[06/23 09:57] <02charlie> that would be my thought
[06/23 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> fabc diaries look clean though
[06/23 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> whats a PSLDASEARCH charlie? pig searches? 
[06/23 10:07] <02charlie> im not sure what PSLDASEARCH is. where do you see that?
[06/23 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> sorry thats a secondary ID that comes up in smapi
[06/23 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> but this guy QRDHC7, shows up a lot in the qbrws error events during the 6 am hr
[06/23 10:11] <02charlie> is he in one of debbie's reports?
[06/23 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> saw a few high arts during the same hr too, the victims of this^ guy... i guess this is what debbie says when people become victims of some other pig searches
[06/23 10:11] <triveni> ok so wayne has applied some code fix in fabc. and we are making sure that it's fine before applying it to prod?
[06/23 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> checking
[06/23 10:12] <02charlie> it's a code fix in the dbd build job (a batch job), but yes
[06/23 10:12] <triveni> ok
[06/23 10:13] <triveni> i think i got an overall gist of what happened..
[06/23 10:13] <triveni> so i can monitor fabc diaries..
[06/23 10:13] <triveni> and try to monitor anything unusual?
[06/23 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> he is not there in the dsk reports
[06/23 10:28] <02charlie> ok, 
[06/23 10:28] <02charlie> amit, there will be another metadata cancel tonight, but because it will be special i want to handle that since i'm the oncaller
[06/23 10:29] <02charlie> (amit and triveni) but we do have two f-card changes that need to be made, one in prod and one in C1. Would you like to split those up? 
[06/23 10:32] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[06/23 10:32] <02charlie> good morning jim, another late night i see
[06/23 10:32] <JimE_zOS> ready for B1 but I have an errand to run with William before I start my drive
[06/23 10:32] <02charlie> sure take your time
[06/23 10:32] <JimE_zOS> if you folks are OK, I'll run that errand now and check in before I start for B1. 
[06/23 10:32] <JimE_zOS> k...phone in hand. 
[06/23 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> sure charlie
[06/23 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> we can do the fcards
[06/23 10:34] <06Amit_ZOS> good morning Jim!
[06/23 10:35] <triveni> good morning Jim!!
[06/23 10:36] <triveni> amit tell me the command for fabc diary check.
[06/23 10:36] <triveni> i don't have my notes with me here.
[06/23 10:36] <triveni> in rosc.. what do we type..
[06/23 10:37] <02charlie> i would just grab a copy of ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(RUNDRYOL)
[06/23 10:37] <triveni> ok 
[06/23 10:38] <02charlie> or ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(RUNDRYAL) if you want to get the LCRE diaries too

[06/23 10:43] <02charlie> ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(RUNDRYUN) will do it for all the unloaded (Prod, at least, don't know I've done it anywhere else) monitors. but i strongly suggest you try and understand everything it is doing before using it or you will be cheating youself of knowledge about how the system works
[06/23 10:44] <triveni> I put fabc in the job
[06/23 10:44] <triveni> and ran it
[06/23 10:44] <triveni> i guess it ll produce staged.* datasets
[06/23 10:45] <02charlie> yes
[06/23 10:45] <triveni> for RUNDRYOL
[06/23 10:45] <triveni> ok
[06/23 10:45] <triveni> I ll remember the RUNDRYRUN.. sounds cool..if we need only unloaded ones..
[06/23 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> i had pinged you the commands on skype
[06/23 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> what happened?
[06/23 10:46] <triveni> i think my skype is not working
[06/23 10:46] <triveni> it shows limited usage
[06/23 10:46] <02charlie> mj.srdiary and mj.sadiary are the rosecoe commands
[06/23 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> 'mj.srdiary all today fabc'
[06/23 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> actally
[06/23 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> *actually
[06/23 10:47] <02charlie> but unlike debbie, i try to stay out of roscoe
[06/23 10:47] <triveni> cool!! tysm
[06/23 10:47] <02charlie> yes, amit is correct
[06/23 10:51] <02charlie> it would also behoove you to understand how the RUNDRYOL job works (and the only difference between RUNDRYAL and RUNDRYOL is that the former also sumits an LCRE$ADD job to add the necessary OPC app to generate the LCRE diaries) 
[06/23 10:51] <06Amit_ZOS> you are owning this rename am i right charlie?
[06/23 10:52] <02charlie> yes
[06/23 10:55] <triveni> dats interesting
[06/23 10:55] <triveni> are we renaming the datasets.. is that what's going on..
[06/23 10:55] <triveni> and why are we doing it?
[06/23 10:56] <02charlie> no, we're canceling the metadata renames
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> okk
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> got it
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> we are not using any new metadata
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> and continuing to use the old dbd's metadata etc
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> am i right?
[06/23 10:56] <02charlie> at the moment, that's what we've been doing since wednesday
[06/23 10:56] <triveni> ok
[06/23 10:57] <02charlie> and we've had the normal renames cancelled every night since then
[06/23 10:57] <triveni> ok
[06/23 10:57] <02charlie> tonight will be a little different from the normal cancellation process
[06/23 10:57] <02charlie> and since im the oncaller, i wanted to be responsible for that
[06/23 10:58] <02charlie> that way, i can only blame myself :)
[06/23 10:58] <triveni> ok please tell us whatever u ll do..
[06/23 10:58] <02charlie> sure
[06/23 10:59] <02charlie> that will be ths faternoon
[06/23 10:59] <triveni> ok
[06/23 10:59] <02charlie> well, hopefully not fater :)

[06/23 11:01] <triveni> that RT base related searches
[06/23 11:02] <triveni> or in general everything unusual?
[06/23 11:02] <02charlie> anything unusual

[06/23 13:29] <triveni> yo
[06/23 13:29] <02charlie> it automagically does that :)
[06/23 13:29] <triveni> it was already there
[06/23 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/23 13:52] <02charlie> jim have you thought any more about SE00CRNDBD and SE00CRNDND010?
[06/23 13:52] <02charlie> and are we doing the dbd thing tonight?
[06/23 13:59] <JimE_zOS> I haven't heard confirmation from Wayne yet, but I suspect we are, Charlie, yes. 
[06/23 13:59] <JimE_zOS> need to run to 1:1, we'll talk afterwards. 
[06/23 13:59] <02charlie> k, thx
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> wayne just lynced me, [6/23/2017 2:23 PM] Lester, Charles (RET-HBE): 
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> we going to put the fixed dbd into prod?
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> [6/23/2017 2:25 PM] Langguth, Wayne A. (LNG-DAY): 
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> Well, if Jim says so.
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> [6/23/2017 2:26 PM] Langguth, Wayne A. (LNG-DAY): 
[06/23 14:32] <02charlie> Trying to get critical mass to proceed with the code promote. Vickie and I are discussing the changes now.
[06/23 14:36] <triveni> wow..
[06/23 14:36] <triveni> the permanent fix about to go..
[06/23 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> More than good enough for Government work Charlie! :P
[06/23 15:06] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/23 15:06] <02charlie> nah, just good enough :)
[06/23 15:11] <JimE_zOS> so let's talk about the DBD and 02:00 
[06/23 15:11] <02charlie> yessir
[06/23 15:11] <JimE_zOS> assuming Wayne's code is released and the SPCE diaries continue to show nothing unexpected...
[06/23 15:12] <JimE_zOS> I think we are ready to go. 
[06/23 15:12] <02charlie> and i assume I6BDBDIC  is the job that builds the dbd
[06/23 15:12] <JimE_zOS> I still need to look at the two DBD rename applications, but here is the general approach. 
[06/23 15:12] <JimE_zOS> I think so, Charlie, yes. 
[06/23 15:13] <JimE_zOS> I'm not really looking for a fresh build....happy to take what is already in FABC/SPCE 
[06/23 15:13] <triveni> can we see that job's run now..
[06/23 15:13] <02charlie> ok
[06/23 15:13] <02charlie> im fine with what's in spce/fabc
[06/23 15:14] <02charlie> especially since im not sure i want a fresh build, considering what they may have done before that build
[06/23 15:14] <02charlie> i would rather their fresh build be next week
[06/23 15:14] <JimE_zOS> right...I'd like to not introduce unknown things with a fresh build. 
[06/23 15:14] <02charlie> ....because then ill be on pto? :D
[06/23 15:14] <JimE_zOS> I much rather a fresh build of the DBD go with a fresh build of the other pieces of metadata next week. 
[06/23 15:14] <02charlie> (joke)
[06/23 15:14] <02charlie> exactly
[06/23 15:15] <02charlie> we're already on thin ice with the way we've handled it so far
[06/23 15:15] <02charlie> as all the gen 0001 bases have shown
[06/23 15:15] <JimE_zOS> so I'll take the "Level 0" DBD, and put it in PREP locations for the critical rename to do its job. 
[06/23 15:15] <02charlie> ok
[06/23 15:16] <JimE_zOS> sometime after the bridging copies start and before 02:00, I'll rename all of the PZ01 datasets to PL00 
[06/23 15:17] <02charlie> i was thinking that would be a tuesday 0100 thing to do
[06/23 15:17] <JimE_zOS> probably need to force the XCF VTOC structure audit to run. 
[06/23 15:17] <JimE_zOS> that is OPC controlled so easy 
[06/23 15:17] <JimE_zOS> the critical rename application(s) will do the rest 
[06/23 15:17] <JimE_zOS> so the DBD will be pushed to LCRE, zLFD, TA and batch 
[06/23 15:18] <02charlie> arent we likely to get the vie error on the PL00 gen 0001s?
[06/23 15:18] <02charlie> they still wont be in the menu
[06/23 15:18] <JimE_zOS> menu has nothing to do with VIE messages. 
[06/23 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> Integrity errors you mean?
[06/23 15:19] <JimE_zOS> might get a few....but the closer I rename to 02:00, the less risk. 
[06/23 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> cool.. will try to come in at midnight
[06/23 15:20] <02charlie> so this L0 DBD will fix the problem that caused us to rename them from PL00 to PZ01?
[06/23 15:20] <JimE_zOS> the need to rename was caused by the DBD fallback itself. 
[06/23 15:20] <JimE_zOS> the old DBD just didn't know about those new bases. 
[06/23 15:21] <02charlie> ah, and this is the version of the DBD that should have been there when? at SOD Wednesday, or sometime later?
[06/23 15:22] <02charlie> some of those bases were reclaimed between 0200 and when, 1200? 1300?
[06/23 15:22] <02charlie> on wednesday
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> are you meeting for midnight..
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> when
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> wats d plan
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> tonight
[06/23 15:23] <02charlie> we're working on that
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> ?
[06/23 15:23] <triveni> ok
[06/23 15:24] <02charlie> wont be any earlier than 0830 IST :)
[06/23 15:24] <triveni> morning
[06/23 15:25] <triveni> i ll be dozing off then.. will catchup later..
[06/23 15:25] <triveni> goodnight all
[06/23 15:25] <triveni> i ll try to peak in morning
[06/23 15:25] <JimE_zOS> reclaimed? 
[06/23 15:26] <JimE_zOS> I don't think any of hte bases we renamed were reclaimed. 
[06/23 15:26] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[06/23 15:31] <JimE_zOS> so does that seem reasonable? 
[06/23 15:31] <02charlie> yes
[06/23 15:32] <02charlie> i will check with bobbie about our gen 0001s
[06/23 15:32] <JimE_zOS> what about them? 
[06/23 15:32] <02charlie> i want to know if any of them were reclaimed and when
[06/23 15:33] <JimE_zOS> I think the gen 1's will be just fine once we put a DBD in place that contains those DB numbers. 
[06/23 15:33] <02charlie> ok
[06/23 15:40] <02charlie> well rule #2 would apply, so i'll just leave it at that :)
[06/23 15:40] <JimE_zOS> Rule #2? 
[06/23 15:41] <02charlie> Jim is never wrong :)
[06/23 15:41] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah....that isn't a rule. 
[06/23 15:41] <JimE_zOS> heck, that isn't even an idea. 
[06/23 15:41] <02charlie> lol (shades of NCIS)
[06/23 15:44] <02charlie> well, what time would you like to start, 0100?
[06/23 16:02] <02charlie> and i see that CRNDBD deals with datasets with a name like *.METADATA.DBD*, while *.DBD* are handled by CRNDBD010  
[06/23 16:07] <02charlie> so we're agreed that we need to keep both those applicationsin the CP
[06/23 16:07] <02charlie> but i will get rid of the rest of them
[06/23 16:22] <JimE_zOS> yes...need both of the DBD apps but not the other IMF tied apps. 
[06/23 16:22] <JimE_zOS> Amit and I are checking the DBD apps and JCL to make sure things are set, BTW 
[06/23 16:22] <02charlie> i created standard CHG0158756 for the cancellations, but i will not include those two apps in the ones nroamlly canceled
[06/23 16:23] <02charlie> i still cancel the normal 2200 apps tho, correct?

[06/23 16:43] <02charlie> why two days in a row has dw run out of monitor space?
[06/23 16:44] <JimE_zOS> because they suck

[06/23 17:03] <JimE_zOS> so true (pigs!) 
[06/23 17:03] <JimE_zOS> I've manually added DW  unload applications to the current plan so that unloads now run every 15 minutes. 
[06/23 17:03] <JimE_zOS> Amit will add more later. 
[06/23 17:04] <JimE_zOS> and I'll change the run cycles so OPC will schedule that way going forward. 
[06/23 17:45] <JimE_zOS> k, Charlie, done with Amit and the DW interruption. 
[06/23 17:46] <JimE_zOS> we have prep DBD datasets, by the right names on the correct volumes everywhere for both teh new and old DBD CRN applications.

[06/24 01:14] <JimE_zOS> nope....too early 
[06/24 01:14] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/24 01:15] <JimE_zOS> the sooner we do that, the greater the risk of integrity and VIE errors.

[06/24 01:15] <06Amit_zOS> ?
[06/24 01:16] <JimE_zOS> we are just waiting to get closer to 02:00 
[06/24 01:16] <JimE_zOS> if I were picking the time, I certainly wouldn't start before 01:30 
[06/24 01:16] <JimE_zOS> 01:45 doesn't sound too bad to me.

[06/24 01:18] <06Amit_zOS> i'm logged into system q and ready with the mask PZ01.LPA4C.D00(DB#)
[06/24 01:18] <JimE_zOS> k...Cluster 3 to Amit. 
[06/24 01:18] <JimE_zOS> I'll take clusters 2 and 4 
[06/24 01:19] <JimE_zOS> leaving Cluster 1 for Charlie 
[06/24 01:19] <02charlie> sure
[06/24 01:20] <02charlie> should i add the cf apps to opcu for say 0200?
[06/24 01:21] <JimE_zOS> thinking about timing...
[06/24 01:22] <JimE_zOS> how about 02:15 and I'll hold the bridge window
[06/24 01:22] <02charlie> sure
[06/24 01:22] <02charlie> i can add them now and not let them autosubmit until we're sure we've gotten the renames done
[06/24 01:23] <JimE_zOS> I think 02:15 will be fine. 
[06/24 01:23] <JimE_zOS> and by holding the bridge window, we ensure no promotes

[06/24 01:25] <06Amit_zOS> I think missed the part where we discussed what SI40CFAUDITCL* does
[06/24 01:25] <JimE_zOS> yep....normal daily runs. 
[06/24 01:26] <02charlie> yep, that's what i figured
[06/24 01:26] <02charlie> so that is set. i'll stay in opcu for now
[06/24 01:27] <02charlie> it refreshes the xcf vtoc amit
[06/24 01:27] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[06/24 01:27] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/24 01:41] <JimE_zOS> BTW, this is the operation I changed: 
[06/24 01:41] <JimE_zOS> OPER 010 STOP Bridge LFD/LSR STCs EOD$EBDG 
[06/24 01:41] <JimE_zOS> in SE00EOD$CONTROL 
[06/24 01:42] <JimE_zOS> to extend the bridge window. 
[06/24 01:42] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/24 01:43] <06Amit_zOS> engines rimming, ready to rename @1:45
[06/24 01:45] <06Amit_zOS> start?
[06/24 01:45] <JimE_zOS> I guess, sure 
[06/24 01:45] <06Amit_zOS> k
[06/24 01:47] <02charlie> cl1 done
[06/24 01:48] <JimE_zOS> done with Clusters 2 and 4 
[06/24 01:52] <06Amit_zOS> DONE WITH 3
[06/24 01:52] <JimE_zOS> k...very good. 
[06/24 01:52] <JimE_zOS> now we wait. 
[06/24 01:53] <06Amit_zOS> you guys had jobs ready, didn't you!?
[06/24 01:53] <02charlie> nope
[06/24 01:53] <02charlie> 3.4
[06/24 01:53] <JimE_zOS> just 3.4 
[06/24 01:54] <02charlie> too lzay to set up a job myself :)
[06/24 01:54] <06Amit_zOS> whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa........ then you folks just have way faster fingers than me
[06/24 01:54] <JimE_zOS> ask Debbie.  She'll tell you I have flying finger. 
[06/24 01:54] <JimE_zOS> fingers, even 
[06/24 01:54] <02charlie> or to spell properly, apparently :)
[06/24 01:55] <JimE_zOS> if you want a suggested OPC application mask, Amit, try: SE00*CRN* 
[06/24 01:55] <JimE_zOS> we care about all of them, but mostly the DBD 
[06/24 01:56] <JimE_zOS> if you'd like to watch CRIT and COLD too, change your mask to SE00C* 
[06/24 01:57] <06Amit_zOS> from 5.2 right?
[06/24 01:57] <02charlie> this must be another clockwatcher app: SE00CHK$MCPYROSE  Check: SE00MCOPYROSE%%%   17/06/23 23.59  C   6  N
[06/24 01:57] <JimE_zOS> CRIT and COLD will both go to "S" status at 02:00. 
[06/24 01:57] <02charlie> yep
[06/24 01:57] <JimE_zOS> 5.2, current plan, yes. 
[06/24 01:58] <JimE_zOS> but even though they are in "S" status, they are waiting on things. 
[06/24 01:58] <JimE_zOS> CRIT is waiting for its OPER to be completed by OPS. 
[06/24 01:58] <JimE_zOS> and COLD it waiting for all of the critical renames to complete and then for its OPER to be completed. 
[06/24 01:59] <JimE_zOS> about 15 seconds 
[06/24 02:00] <JimE_zOS> "S" status 
[06/24 02:00] <06Amit_zOS> crit satrted
[06/24 02:00] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/24 02:00] <JimE_zOS> it went to "S" status. 
[06/24 02:00] <JimE_zOS> it will sit that way until OPS does their thing 
[06/24 02:01] <06Amit_zOS> critical renames underway i see
[06/24 02:02] <06Amit_zOS> crit completed
[06/24 02:02] <06Amit_zOS> crndbd's still in 's' though
[06/24 02:02] <06Amit_zOS> isn't that a part of crit?
[06/24 02:02] <06Amit_zOS> or is it part of cold?
[06/24 02:02] <JimE_zOS> not part of COLD 
[06/24 02:02] <JimE_zOS> let me explain: 
[06/24 02:02] <JimE_zOS> SE00CRNDBD        DBD Critical Rename       17/06/24 02.00  C 
[06/24 02:02] <JimE_zOS> SE00CRNDBD010     DBD RENAME                17/06/24 02.00  S 
[06/24 02:03] <JimE_zOS> new DBD app (without the 010) is done.  Perfect. 
[06/24 02:03] <JimE_zOS> old DBD rename (with the 010) has an operation in it that runs later (backup) 
[06/24 02:03] <JimE_zOS> so that application will stay in "S" status for hours. 
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> but if you look at the operation list, you'll see that all of the parts that matter to us are done. 
[06/24 02:04] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> and these applications were added to the current plan dynamically: 
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> SE00TMETACRN$DBD  dbd            /promote   17/06/24 02.01  C   9  N  P 
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> SE00TMETACRN$LVL  lxevol         /promote   17/06/24 02.01  C   9  N  P 
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> SE00TMETAPRE$DBD  dbd            /preprod   17/06/24 02.01  C   7  N  P 
[06/24 02:04] <JimE_zOS> SE00TMETAPRE$LVL  lxevol         /preprod   17/06/24 02.01  C   7  N  P 
[06/24 02:05] <JimE_zOS> SE001CMETADBDCRN  dbd         /criticalRen  17/06/24 02.01  C   7  N  E  
[06/24 02:05] <JimE_zOS> SE001BMETA$DBD    OLSBatch:DBD              17/06/24 02.01  C   9  N  E 
[06/24 02:06] <JimE_zOS> SE001ZMETA$DBD    dbd                /CHPG  17/06/24 02.01  C   7  N  E 
[06/24 02:06] <06Amit_zOS>  yeah, one operation DBD backup was in Ready status
[06/24 02:06] <06Amit_zOS> there was just one in waiting, and the rest completed
[06/24 02:06] <JimE_zOS> all of the above (minus the LXEVOL) is normal dynamic add when a DBD rename is done. 
[06/24 02:06] <JimE_zOS> those all worked too. 
[06/24 02:06] <JimE_zOS> so far, so good. 
[06/24 02:07] <JimE_zOS> copies should be starting....so why don't we go back to our assigned clusters and check the started task logs for DBDINDEX messages. 
[06/24 02:07] <06Amit_zOS> how do we do that?
[06/24 02:08] <JimE_zOS> no messages for 22 or 23. 
[06/24 02:08] <JimE_zOS> go to IOF, pick a newly started copy (like 42 or 43) and browse the output. 
[06/24 02:08] <JimE_zOS> the very first file is the started task log (or STC log) 
[06/24 02:08] <02charlie> none for 12 13
[06/24 02:08] <JimE_zOS> just do a FIND DBDINDEX 
[06/24 02:09] <JimE_zOS> oh, sorry, you had cluster 3. 
[06/24 02:09] <JimE_zOS> pick copies 32 or 33
[06/24 02:09] <02charlie> a0 is clean too
[06/24 02:09] <JimE_zOS> I don't find any messages in clusters 2 or 4 
[06/24 02:10] <JimE_zOS> again...good

[06/24 02:11] <02charlie> sorry, that was from earlier
[06/24 02:11] <02charlie> nevermind
[06/24 02:11] <06Amit_zOS> im in iof
[06/24 02:11] <JimE_zOS> yeah....before the CRN
[06/24 02:11] <JimE_zOS> k...ignoring. 
[06/24 02:11] <06Amit_zOS> what goes into the jobname again?
[06/24 02:11] <JimE_zOS> Amit, type PREFIX SR0*
[06/24 02:11] <JimE_zOS> you'll see a list of the production SR copies. 
[06/24 02:12] <JimE_zOS> put a "B" in front of SR032Q 
[06/24 02:12] <06Amit_zOS> browsing 32
[06/24 02:12] <JimE_zOS> and then FIND DBDINDEX 
[06/24 02:12] <02charlie> a1 is clean, just started
[06/24 02:12] <JimE_zOS> you shouldn't find a match 
[06/24 02:12] <JimE_zOS> does that help? 
[06/24 02:13] <02charlie> A6 is clean
[06/24 02:13] <06Amit_zOS> i did not find any match
[06/24 02:13] <06Amit_zOS> that helped
[06/24 02:13] <06Amit_zOS> thanks
[06/24 02:13] <02charlie> 17 good
[06/24 02:13] <JimE_zOS> you might check another copy....just to be sure. 
[06/24 02:13] <JimE_zOS> SR033Q would be another Wave 1 copy. 
[06/24 02:14] <02charlie> and 18
[06/24 02:14] <JimE_zOS> Charlie is being very complete.  I was happy to just check 2 per cluster. 
[06/24 02:14] <06Amit_zOS> 34 clean
[06/24 02:14] <06Amit_zOS> i checked 32 and 34
[06/24 02:14] <06Amit_zOS> 33 clean too
[06/24 02:14] <JimE_zOS> k....I think we are good there.

[06/24 02:18] <06Amit_zOS> are we done?
[06/24 02:19] <JimE_zOS> I think we are, yes. 
[06/24 02:20] <JimE_zOS> it is a little early to run a diary 
[06/24 02:20] <JimE_zOS> so I don't know that there is much more we can do. 
[06/24 02:20] <06Amit_zOS> yes it is i guess
[06/24 02:20] <JimE_zOS> maybe Charlie could run a related terms search? 
[06/24 02:20] <06Amit_zOS> in prod?
[06/24 02:20] <02charlie> sure
[06/24 02:20] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[06/24 02:20] <JimE_zOS> we are allowed. :-)
[06/24 02:21] <06Amit_zOS> offcourse
[06/24 02:21] <06Amit_zOS> i will run the diaries once he is done with the search then to see what happend
[06/24 02:22] <JimE_zOS> you can try.  Running diaries now will be more difficult due to end of day 
[06/24 02:22] <02charlie> firefox is updating :(
[06/24 02:23] <06Amit_zOS> if you can tell me how i can run it, i can do it for you
[06/24 02:23] <02charlie> im there
[06/24 02:23] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/24 02:23] <02charlie> got results
[06/24 02:24] <06Amit_zOS> now do i giive some time before running the diaries or will it be available if i run the rpf immediately?
[06/24 02:25] <02charlie> id wait until at least 0230
[06/24 02:25] <JimE_zOS> it'll be there, but it'll be mixed up with a bunch of yesterday stuff 
[06/24 02:27] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[06/24 02:29] <06Amit_zOS> diaries are clean
[06/24 02:31] <06Amit_zOS> 2nd run clean too
[06/24 02:34] <JimE_zOS> then I vote we are done. 
[06/24 02:34] <02charlie> i agree
[06/24 02:34] <JimE_zOS> not related, but the error list looks good too :-)
[06/24 02:35] <02charlie> yes
[06/24 02:36] <06Amit_zOS> Awesome, i can run diaries after i wake up today morning

[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:17] <charlie> which is a bit unuual
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:17] <charlie> and i've had two UC jobs fail this afternoon
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:18] <PSO_MattD_TL> both jobs on the same server?
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:18] <charlie> yep
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:18] <PSO_MattD_TL> I bet that server doesn't have all of its mounts
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:22] <PSO_MattD_TL> we can either page REPH Open systems to take a look now or have them check tomorrow
[06/25 16:47] <02charlie> [06/25 16:22] <PSO_MattD_TL> not sure if anyone is online to take a look at the moment
[06/25 16:48] <02charlie> [06/25 16:29] <charlie> probably can wait until tomorrow, but it will have to be addressed tomorrow, because lots of things will start hurting tomorrow 
[06/25 16:48] <02charlie> [06/25 16:29] <charlie> apparently, when it rebooted at 1200, it didnt manage to reconnect all the filesystems

[06/25 20:26] <06Amit_ZOS> hey Charlie , cpc1676 is a cert box is it?
[06/25 20:26] <06Amit_ZOS> we dont support that though right?
[06/25 20:28] <02charlie> its the C1 box, we do
[06/25 20:29] <06Amit_ZOS> ow
[06/25 20:31] <06Amit_ZOS> i've never really troubleshooted c1 before
[06/25 20:31] <06Amit_ZOS> you login to the unix boxes is it>
[06/25 20:31] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[06/25 20:32] <02charlie> yes
[06/25 20:32] <02charlie> just like the prod boxes
[06/25 20:32] <06Amit_ZOS> i see.. and the mainframe side of things? in tsoc?
[06/25 20:33] <02charlie> those are the apps that run the UC commands to talk to cpc1676
[06/25 20:34] <06Amit_ZOS> UC commands? Update?
[06/25 20:35] <06Amit_ZOS> and this is a p3 so you were'nt paged i hope
[06/25 20:35] <02charlie> correct
[06/25 20:36] <02charlie> I saw the ticket about 3pm, but i waited until the crecheck app failed, because that told me it was probably UC/LDAP
[06/25 20:36] <06Amit_ZOS> hm..
[06/25 20:42] <02charlie> and then when i logged in and got the chdir error, that sealed it
[06/25 20:42] <06Amit_ZOS> :D
[06/25 21:06] <06Amit_ZOS> I will see you tomorrow charlie! :)

[06/26 08:10] <Charlie_merely_lurking> UC = Universal Command, Amit
[06/26 08:10] <Charlie_merely_lurking> it's a tool we use to manage operations across platforms
[06/26 08:14] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[06/26 08:14] <Charlie_merely_lurking> hi jim
[06/26 08:15] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i've got a number of c1 apps in error, but since c1 doesnt run sunday night, i elected to leave them that way and ask your advice this morning
[06/26 08:15] <Charlie_merely_lurking> can i just complete the latest ones and delete the older ones
[06/26 08:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> they fixed cpc1676 this morning, so it's not fully funtional
[06/26 08:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> *now* fully functional
[06/26 08:16] <JimE_zOS> better not, Charlie. (delete/complete) 
[06/26 08:16] <Charlie_merely_lurking> that's why i wanted to ask
[06/26 08:16] <JimE_zOS> let me look more, please 
[06/26 08:17] <Charlie_merely_lurking> sure
[06/26 08:18] <Charlie_merely_lurking> my email explains my thought process
[06/26 08:29] <JimE_zOS> this is a mess. 
[06/26 08:29] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yes
[06/26 08:30] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i didnt realize what a mess it would make, or i would have had them fix cpc1676 sunday afternoon
[06/26 08:31] <Charlie_merely_lurking> but my thought was, c1 is (1) a test systems and (2) doesnt run on sunday
[06/26 08:32] <Charlie_merely_lurking> so i thought it could wait
[06/26 08:37] <JimE_zOS> agree....test system.  And I certainly hate to interrupt a person's weekend for a cert thing. 
[06/26 08:37] <JimE_zOS> RD refuses to accept weekend pages.  Period. 
[06/26 08:37] <JimE_zOS> so I follow your logic. 
[06/26 08:38] <JimE_zOS> in the case of C1, "justice delayed is justice denied". :-)
[06/26 08:38] <Charlie_merely_lurking> lol
[06/26 08:38] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yeah, i see that the way its wrapped around the axle
[06/26 08:39] <JimE_zOS> better now, but I won't promise that it'll start cleanly tonight. 
[06/26 08:39] <JimE_zOS> I'll add a calendar entry to watch its start-up
[06/26 08:39] <Charlie_merely_lurking> so what did you do?
[06/26 08:40] * triveni has joined #theRock
[06/26 08:40] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[06/26 08:40] <Charlie_merely_lurking> good evening triveni
[06/26 08:43] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i hope you shared yur comment on the factoid with doug P
[06/26 08:43] <JimE_zOS> I didn't. 
[06/26 08:43] <JimE_zOS> He'll have his own (much funnier) comment. 
[06/26 08:43] <Charlie_merely_lurking> lol
[06/26 08:44] <JimE_zOS> to clean-up C1, I looked at the apps, in run order, to remind myself of what apps do which things. 
[06/26 08:44] <JimE_zOS> with an eye toward start-up tonight. '
[06/26 08:44] <triveni> good evening Charlie..
[06/26 08:44] <triveni> hows everything here..
[06/26 08:44] <triveni> i m yet to see my mails..
[06/26 08:44] <JimE_zOS> since COLD didnt' run at all, and CRIT failed, I worried about LVTs and dump datasets
[06/26 08:44] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Triveni. 
[06/26 08:45] <triveni> hello Jim!!
[06/26 08:45] <triveni> in short.. are v good here or not..
[06/26 08:45] <triveni> or are v in trouble..
[06/26 08:45] <JimE_zOS> no trouble....at least not now. 
[06/26 08:46] <JimE_zOS> C1 start-up might be goofed, but we won't know that until 17:00 tonight. 
[06/26 08:46] <triveni> ok.. i know i can rely on ur words :)
[06/26 08:46] <triveni> ok..
[06/26 08:46] <triveni> m here..if u need me..
[06/26 08:48] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yeah, i was concerned about those, but i thought c1 grabbed a copy of those before running cold
[06/26 08:48] <Charlie_merely_lurking> from spce
[06/26 08:48] <JimE_zOS> LVTs? 
[06/26 08:48] <JimE_zOS> nope...has to make his own. 
[06/26 08:48] <Charlie_merely_lurking> ah
[06/26 08:49] <JimE_zOS> anyway, you should be gone (right?) on vacation.
[06/26 08:50] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yeah, but i didnt want to just dump a pile and walk away without fixing it
[06/26 08:50] <JimE_zOS> all better now. 
[06/26 08:51] <JimE_zOS> you had a long week....I suggest you disengage. 
[06/26 08:52] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yeah, i want to understand before i do. so did you complete the apps, or complete some and delete some?
[06/26 08:52] <Charlie_merely_lurking> and in what order
[06/26 08:53] <triveni> i dont see anythng in opc error list
[06/26 08:53] <JimE_zOS> completed all, but in order and sometime only an operation in the application. 
[06/26 08:54] <Charlie_merely_lurking> i know your preference for completing rather than deleting because of the dependencies issues
[06/26 08:54] <JimE_zOS> unless I know the external dependency structure, I'd rather not delete. 
[06/26 08:55] <triveni> so they all failed due to dataspace issue
[06/26 08:55] <Charlie_merely_lurking> yeah, i deleted the LCRE$CHECK apps, but i know they have no external dependencies
[06/26 08:55] <Charlie_merely_lurking> no, they failed because cpc1676 wasn't functional
[06/26 08:56] <triveni> ok
[06/26 08:56] <Charlie_merely_lurking> some of the later ones failed because COLD hadnt been able to run
[06/26 08:56] <triveni> ohh
[06/26 08:56] <triveni> is the box working now
[06/26 08:56] <Charlie_merely_lurking> box is fine now
[06/26 08:56] <triveni> and why was it not functional..
[06/26 08:56] <Charlie_merely_lurking> it had no home directory after it rebooted
[06/26 08:57] <triveni> so we rebooted it again..
[06/26 08:57] <triveni> i mean the unix guys..
[06/26 08:57] <Charlie_merely_lurking> no, the support people fixed the network file share system (nfs)
[06/26 08:57] <Charlie_merely_lurking> which then allowed the home directory to work
[06/26 08:58] <triveni> ok
[06/26 08:58] <triveni> ok
[06/26 08:58] <JimE_zOS> I wish we could do that ourselves, but we can't 
[06/26 08:58] <triveni> ok
[06/26 08:58] <JimE_zOS> truth be told, not our area and I worry about the things that would come our way if we did have that ability 
[06/26 08:59] <JimE_zOS> so best to leave that as-is. 
[06/26 08:59] <triveni> ok
[06/26 09:03] <JimE_zOS> if we are good, I'll step away and finish my B1 prep. 
[06/26 09:03] <Charlie_merely_lurking> we're good, and thank you, jim
[06/26 09:03] <JimE_zOS> sure!
[06/26 09:03] <triveni> Thank you Jim!!
[06/26 09:03] <JimE_zOS> enjoy UR week, Charlie.

[06/26 11:48] <JimE_zOS> sorry for the delay....Randy wanted to talk about some RACF items. 
[06/26 11:55] <JimE_zOS> for those interested, I've changed the DW unload application schedule to run every 15 minutes throughout the day 
[06/26 11:55] <JimE_zOS> two issues last week with monitor exhaustion. 
[06/26 11:56] <JimE_zOS> so 2 copies filled 99 monitor datasets in 30 minutes. 
[06/26 11:56] <dsk_hbe> thanks!!!!
[06/26 11:57] <JimE_zOS> if they crap out again, I'll start shutting down copies to conserve monitor datasets. 
[06/26 11:57] <dsk_hbe> such an annoying process.

[06/26 12:14] <JimE_zOS> and, BTW, Debbie, I plan to watch C1 start-up tonight. 
[06/26 12:14] <JimE_zOS> good reminder. 
[06/26 12:14] <triveni> ok debbie..
[06/26 12:14] <06Amit_ZOS> will do debbie
[06/26 12:15] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee.  BRB 
[06/26 12:15] <dsk_hbe> Thanks very much for that (C1), Jim!!
[06/26 12:16] <triveni> my lync is behaving weird..not sure why..
[06/26 12:16] <triveni> juggling with slow connection here.

[06/26 13:33] <06Amit_ZOS> guys, would you mind if i make a quick run to the bmv?
[06/26 13:33] <06Amit_ZOS> i will grab some lunch on the way too
[06/26 13:33] <dsk_hbe> ok!  I'll grab any pages until you return
[06/26 13:34] <06Amit_ZOS> Thank you!
[06/26 13:34] <06Amit_ZOS> :)
[06/26 13:34] <triveni> m here if u need my help debbie..
[06/26 13:34] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[06/26 13:34] <dsk_hbe> ok!
[06/26 13:34] <triveni> :)
[06/26 13:39] <triveni> debbie what is an ap change?
[06/26 13:42] <JimE_zOS> quick trip to the BMV?  This really is his first car :-)
[06/26 13:42] <dsk_hbe> I am not sure what Scott means by it exactly but since he works on automation, I assume automation something... process maybe.
[06/26 13:43] <dsk_hbe> LOL, Jim!  I don't know why that didn't occur to me ;-)
[06/26 13:43] <JimE_zOS> I think he is talking about Automation Point (ie, filter and focal point). 
[06/26 13:43] <JimE_zOS> and to be honest, I'm not sure why we'd pull those rules. 
[06/26 13:43] <JimE_zOS> I'd think hiding gen 1 noise would be fine all of the time. 
[06/26 13:43] <dsk_hbe> oh thanks, Jim!
[06/26 13:44] <triveni> okkk..
[06/26 13:44] <dsk_hbe> oh please do let him know that then.  It wasn't clear to me what the change was about.  All I saw was Charlie saying he could undo it.
[06/26 13:44] <JimE_zOS> and I guess he can. 
[06/26 13:44] <JimE_zOS> but gen 1's are so goofy. 
[06/26 13:44] <dsk_hbe> normally those go to fabsup first, right?
[06/26 13:45] <JimE_zOS> and if the timing is a little off between the DBD and the metadata tooling automation, noise. 
[06/26 13:45] <JimE_zOS> I think so, yes. 
[06/26 13:45] <dsk_hbe> yes they are... when I just read some of the emails briefly while on vacation... too many to catch up that way... I was soooo hoping part fo the issue was Wayne fixing that nuisance... sad to see that wasn't the case ;-)
[06/26 13:46] <JimE_zOS> I suspect the addtional gen 1 Charlie mentioned after the DBD fix was probably just that, bad timing 
[06/26 13:46] <dsk_hbe> probably so
[06/26 13:47] <JimE_zOS> although, without the message we wouldn't know things were dorked until Gen 2 :-)
[06/26 13:47] <dsk_hbe> in our error exceptions we still have one asking them to ignore them for C1
[06/26 13:47] <JimE_zOS> yeah, this made that come to mind. 
[06/26 13:47] <JimE_zOS> this event, that is. 
[06/26 13:48] <triveni> so its the same dbd issue related.. scott applied some temp fix..and he is just asking wen would be the good time to remove it..
[06/26 13:48] <JimE_zOS> not the same issue at all, Triveni. 
[06/26 13:49] <JimE_zOS> last week's problem was a structural problem inside teh DBD 
[06/26 13:49] <triveni> ohk
[06/26 13:49] <JimE_zOS> this is just bad timing.  Gen 1 of a new base was created before the new DBD was installed. 
[06/26 13:49] <JimE_zOS> tonight at 02:00 that should stop as an error. 
[06/26 13:50] <triveni> ok
[06/26 13:51] <JimE_zOS> if not, Debbie knows who to call  (Ghost Busters!) 
[06/26 13:51] <dsk_hbe> I coitainly do! :-}
[06/26 13:53] <triveni> not sure about ghost bursters..who are they..but i understood the issue..
[06/26 13:53] <JimE_zOS> movie reference, Triveni. 
[06/26 13:54] <triveni> lol ;) hahaha
[06/26 14:11] <JimE_zOS> need coffee.  BRB 
[06/26 14:26] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/26 14:54] <JimE_zOS> adjusted XM, BTW 
[06/26 14:54] <JimE_zOS> I took daytime away from Debbie so she can leave on time. 
[06/26 14:54] <JimE_zOS> I also took early AM. 
[06/26 14:55] <dsk_hbe> oh thanks!!  I woudl have forgotten to change daytime.  You are kind to take early am, but I can sure keep it too.  I'll just say thanks on that and run though ;-)
[06/26 14:56] <JimE_zOS> your choice, Debbie.  I'm willing to keep the slot....but didn't want to take it unannounced. 
[06/26 14:56] <dsk_hbe> I'll stick with my last sentence ;-)
[06/26 14:56] <JimE_zOS> perfect. 
[06/26 14:59] <JimE_zOS> unless somebody objects, I'm going to ask Wayne to change the integrity error messages so that they no longer go to the system console.  They will continue to come to the filter/focal point machines.  Acceptable? 
[06/26 15:00] <dsk_hbe> sure fine by me
[06/26 15:01] <JimE_zOS> fine by Debbie, Debbie is in charge, ergo "Nike"  (Just Do It!) 
[06/26 15:02] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/26 15:05] <triveni> i ll be leaving now..
[06/26 15:05] <triveni> goodnight all
[06/26 15:05] <dsk_hbe> bye!
[06/26 15:05] <triveni> bye debbie!!
[06/26 15:06] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[06/26 15:07] <JimE_zOS> bye, Triveni! 
[06/26 15:08] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/26 15:10] <JimE_zOS> was the BMV everything you hoped it would be? :-)
[06/26 15:10] <dsk_hbe> wow, I suspect it was more ;-)
[06/26 15:14] <06Amit_zOS> Well, i thought, a monday afternoon would warrant a very thin crowd at the bmv, but apparently, i was wrong
[06/26 15:14] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[06/26 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> but, i had been to that bmv before for my car registration, so was not totally lost there..
[06/26 15:15] <JimE_zOS> Monday near the end of the month.  Bzzzzzt! 
[06/26 15:16] <JimE_zOS> on the plus side, probably better today than tomorrow. 
[06/26 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> but the actual process was quick enough.. got my ohio license!
[06/26 15:17] <dsk_hbe> which cartoon movie was it that had the sloth working at teh BMV?  That's Ohio BMV for sure.
[06/26 15:18] <JimE_zOS> 2319!  2319!  
[06/26 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> zootopia
[06/26 15:19] <JimE_zOS> Monstor's Inc.....but she didn't work at the BMV.  Some office that required paperwork all of the time. 
[06/26 15:19] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, zootopia was what I was thinking of but I forgot about Monsters
[06/26 15:20] <JimE_zOS> I love that scene where they take the child's sock off the back of a monstor, bolt a dome to the floor and blow up the sock. 
[06/26 15:20] <JimE_zOS> 2319! 
[06/26 15:20] <dsk_hbe> what is 2319?
[06/26 15:20] <JimE_zOS> their code for human contamination. 
[06/26 15:21] <dsk_hbe> LOL, I would never have remembered that :-)
[06/26 15:21] <JimE_zOS> when they spot the sock, somebody starts yelling "2319!" 
[06/26 15:21] <06Amit_zOS> i remember that scene!
[06/26 15:21] <06Amit_zOS> hillarious!
[06/26 15:24] <JimE_zOS> no idea why "2319" stuck with me, but it did. 
[06/26 15:25] <06Amit_zOS> how do i copy your rpf debbie?
[06/26 15:25] <dsk_hbe> my jcl? for the userrpt?
[06/26 15:25] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/26 15:26] <dsk_hbe> if you have it in fron of you just type something like 'save userrpt'
[06/26 15:26] <dsk_hbe> and it will now be in your account too with the name userrpt
[06/26 15:27] <dsk_hbe> if oyu prefer it in a jcllib, I can copy it to mine and you can copy it from there?
[06/26 15:28] <06Amit_zOS> i couldn't get to your jcl from my rosc
[06/26 15:28] <06Amit_zOS> it didn't fetch it.. i do not know how.. 
[06/26 15:28] <dsk_hbe> I meant if you wanted it over in your TSO land JCLLIB (assumign you have one)
[06/26 15:28] <06Amit_zOS> jcl lib is much easier for me..yes
[06/26 15:29] <06Amit_zOS> no i meant i didn't know how to copy yours in roscoe land
[06/26 15:29] <dsk_hbe> you shodul be able to find it here now as well - UKAMBDS.ISPF.JCLLIB(USERRPT)
[06/26 15:30] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Debbie! :)
[06/26 15:30] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/26 15:33] <dsk_hbe> OK, have email caught up and timesheets caught up... that's enough for now.  Cya tomorrow!

[06/27 09:52] <triveni> hello Jim!!
[06/27 09:53] <dsk_hbe> no Jim, just me stealing his normal greeting :-)
[06/27 09:53] <triveni> ohh i didn't see the name there..
[06/27 09:53] <triveni> lol
[06/27 09:53] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[06/27 09:53] <triveni> i just assumed its Jim..
[06/27 09:54] <triveni> my bad..
[06/27 09:59] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey debbie, what do you do if some library source files "are not part of your subscription" when you try to search something in cert?
[06/27 10:01] <dsk_hbe> I'm surprised you are restricted to too much... what source is it?
[06/27 10:02] <triveni> probably it will be the privilleges of the lexis id
[06/27 10:02] <triveni> whatever sources are tagged to the lexis id.. we can only see that..
[06/27 10:02] <triveni> is it?
[06/27 10:02] <06Amit_ZOS> INNEWS
[06/27 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> XDMINT (file
[06/27 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> )
[06/27 10:03] <dsk_hbe> yes it will be setup via your ID.  ah, innews... let me see if I can tell why you are restricted.  meantime, you can try the group generic ID, sec.
[06/27 10:03] <dsk_hbe> btw, I thought it was inews (one N)
[06/27 10:04] <dsk_hbe> to try the group ID, go to the ss sharepoint - https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/sys-sup/default.aspx

[06/27 10:05] <dsk_hbe> then on the left column choose prod how to's and other information
[06/27 10:05] <dsk_hbe> go down to the passwords link and choose that
[06/27 10:06] <dsk_hbe> see if the user ID/passwords listed there will work where you are at.
[06/27 10:06] <dsk_hbe> what is your ID, Amit?
[06/27 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> lexis id?
[06/27 10:07] <dsk_hbe> whatever ID you were signed in with when you tried to use it
[06/27 10:07] <dsk_hbe> what product were you in?
[06/27 10:07] <dsk_hbe> or were you in Classic?

[06/27 10:14] <dsk_hbe> I'll send you my screen capture and maybe you can see from there if you are in the wrong place.  I'd hope you have full access to this... not sure how they'd restrict anything.
[06/27 10:15] <dsk_hbe> but they must (via limited access)... sec
[06/27 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 10:17] <dsk_hbe> actually sent it to JimC and copied you so he can say how to give you access, hopefully.  Meantime, I'll give you that group ID to try, sec

[06/27 10:18] <dsk_hbe> but I suspect it will fail too... my ID fails as well.  I think this is likely because inews is only tied to Classic menus
[06/27 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[06/27 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 10:18] <dsk_hbe> checkign that, sec
[06/27 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> and yes, our left hand side menu is different
[06/27 10:19] <dsk_hbe> yep, based on what you pasted I think you are missign the limited access items so I asked him to help us get you those
[06/27 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> ok cool
[06/27 10:21] <dsk_hbe> ok, I am not finding inews in the normal menus I'd expect it to be in for LDC use, so your alternative is to use Classic to access it.  Are you looking at it due to a user's issue you are investigating? 
[06/27 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> no, just checking for bad docs
[06/27 10:21] <dsk_hbe> where did you encounter the bad doc?
[06/27 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> not likely cz numbere of lcre call fails on that was low.. so i dont think its bad
[06/27 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> in charlies nightly jobs
[06/27 10:22] <dsk_hbe> can you paste me the line where you saw it?
[06/27 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> ,ULESTCX.PROD.LCRLIB(XX170626)
[06/27 10:23] <dsk_hbe> does that just include one line?
[06/27 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> 1 075420 H0 DB/G=1ASF,0027 CRE Call Failed on Document LNI: 5393-82P0-C35C-33D0 NFXG8K CRE$8E+00B2A             3
[06/27 10:23] <dsk_hbe> there ya go...
[06/27 10:23] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> yeah, those CRE$8E docs are still retrievable
[06/27 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> lol!
[06/27 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks Charlie!
[06/27 10:24] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> now i'd suspect the CREXDD+00080 one is not
[06/27 10:24] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> do i'd create a ticket to whack it
[06/27 10:24] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> and you might want to search for the LNI in SNow too, there may be a ticket on it
[06/27 10:24] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, Amit, I don't use Charlie's jobs/output.  So pointing me to those is not worthwhile for me.  And fwiw, that does look to include a userID - NFXG8K... which is a Rosetta user... so by you looking this up via LDC you are already not doing what the user did

[06/27 10:25] <06Amit_ZOS> INC01567455
[06/27 10:25] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> how did c1 do yesterday evening?
[06/27 10:25] <06Amit_ZOS> it went fine as per Jim
[06/27 10:25] <JimE_zOS> perfect.  Clean start-up. 
[06/27 10:26] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> well, duplicate that ticket, and get them to whack it again
[06/27 10:26] <JimE_zOS> aren't you on vacation, Droid-boy? :-)
[06/27 10:26] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> refer them to the previous ticket, and tell then not to put it online until it's fix
[06/27 10:26] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> but check to make sure it still does fail first
[06/27 10:27] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> i'm not the droid you're seeking :D
[06/27 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> Ok Charlie!
[06/27 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> will do
[06/27 10:27] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> whos' charle? ;)
[06/27 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> Ok Droid!
[06/27 10:27] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> :D
[06/27 10:28] <dsk_hbe> if you are done with me, Amit, I'll go back to what I was doing.  Yell if you have another question.
[06/27 10:28] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah, Debbie, thanks for that info.. but could you tell me how you knew from the id that its a rosetta user?
[06/27 10:28] <dsk_hbe> sec
[06/27 10:28] <dsk_hbe> this command via casenet - /home/tpf816/ss/bin/chkdig NFXG8K
[06/27 10:29] <dsk_hbe> that shows you his only menu is ROSETA (misspelled on purpose to take up only 6 characters)
[06/27 10:29] <06Amit_ZOS> what was the host name for casenet?
[06/27 10:29] <06Amit_ZOS> tpx898?
[06/27 10:30] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> yep
[06/27 10:30] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/27 10:30] <dsk_hbe> that shodul work, but I use tpcz979
[06/27 10:30] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, go on vacation
[06/27 10:30] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> who's charlie? ::looking around:: :D
[06/27 10:30] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> :-)
[06/27 10:31] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> -)
[06/27 10:31] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> )
[06/27 10:31] <dsk_hbe> bye :-)
[06/27 10:31] <06Amit_ZOS> I forget, whats LDAP pwd.. ?! :-(
[06/27 10:32] <06Amit_ZOS> it keeps asking two passwords
[06/27 10:32] <JimE_zOS> because casenet is a different password than your legal password 
[06/27 10:32] <JimE_zOS> suggesting you haven't entered the password that casenet wants. 
[06/27 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> got it.. its the one they had assigned to me
[06/27 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> so if you got it right the first time, it wont ask LDAP or any other useless stuff
[06/27 10:34] <JimE_zOS> right....correct password gets you to casenet directly. 
[06/27 10:34] <JimE_zOS> incorrect password and you get the LDAP prompt.

[06/27 10:35] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Triveni 
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> morning Jim!!
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> dont forget me.. i ll b back soon..
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> dont shower too much love on Amit please..
[06/27 10:35] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/27 10:35] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[06/27 10:35] <JimE_zOS> you are very unforgettable, I assure you. 
[06/27 10:35] <dsk_hbe> how is your visit going, Triveni?
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> yey!!
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> its amazing
[06/27 10:35] <triveni> my hometown is v pretty
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> it has amazing waterfalls
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> am enjoying my time with family..
[06/27 10:36] <dsk_hbe> great! send pictures :-)
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> so far covered 2 big ones..
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> yes sure..
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> one of them resembles like Niagara..
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> and its monsoon.. i mean rainy season. so too much water everywhere..
[06/27 10:36] <triveni> very pleasant view..
[06/27 10:36] <06Amit_ZOS> rm: remove /var/tmp/nenminax.tmp1 (yes/no)?
[06/27 10:37] <06Amit_ZOS> this is what it asks when i give that command debbie!
[06/27 10:37] <JimE_zOS> why do you ask? 
[06/27 10:37] <JimE_zOS> did it prompt you to do that? 
[06/27 10:37] <dsk_hbe> I was amazed to learn years ago when we moved to Phoenix, that they had monsoons... not what I expected from such a climate
[06/27 10:37] <06Amit_ZOS> it asked me
[06/27 10:37] <triveni> ;)
[06/27 10:37] <06Amit_ZOS> when i gave this command:  /home/tpf816/ss/bin/chkdig NFXG8K
[06/27 10:38] <dsk_hbe> you must have some leftover something. Let's ask JimC... he wrote the script.  I'll email him
[06/27 10:38] <JimE_zOS> tmp is transient stuff, so, sure...delete. 
[06/27 10:38] <JimE_zOS> TURN THE KEY, SIR! 
[06/27 10:38] <06Amit_ZOS> thats what i thought, but its unix and i dont know squat, so i thought i'd better ask "those people"!
[06/27 10:38] <dsk_hbe> I thought that too Jim, but was surprised to see the /var ahead of it... do as he says first, Amit... if it still annoys you then we'll ask JimC
[06/27 10:39] <JimE_zOS> agree....the /var seems odd. 
[06/27 10:39] <JimE_zOS> but, heck, its casenet. 
[06/27 10:39] <dsk_hbe> so very true
[06/27 10:40] <06Amit_ZOS> i got it!
[06/27 10:40] <dsk_hbe> yay
[06/27 10:40] <06Amit_ZOS> saw rosetta and the  BANK OF N T BUTTERFIELD & SON LTD
[06/27 10:41] <dsk_hbe> cool
[06/27 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> but it asked me to delete stuff a lot of times
[06/27 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway..
[06/27 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, you in B1?
[06/27 10:41] <JimE_zOS> I am, yes. 
[06/27 10:42] <JimE_zOS> but you won't find me at my desk right now....getting coffee :-)
[06/27 10:42] <JimE_zOS> BRB 
[06/27 10:42] <dsk_hbe> if it is a big pain we can ask JimC sicne he wrote it.  You know him I think... don't hesitate to ask him.  smart guy
[06/27 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> then, in a few mins, i guess it will be.."Need a splash of coffee. BRB"
[06/27 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[06/27 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Jinx
[06/27 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> will do Debbie!
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> today i got to know MIRC is the lightest application..
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> it starts before my skype and outlook
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> coz here the net speed is really slow..
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> i live in interiors..
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> a v small town..
[06/27 10:43] <triveni> but m liking MiRC more now..
[06/27 10:44] <triveni> its keeping me somehow connected..
[06/27 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> You better get the cooker!
[06/27 10:44] <triveni> oops!!
[06/27 10:44] <triveni> i haven't bought it..
[06/27 10:44] <triveni> but i will
[06/27 10:44] <triveni> sure..
[06/27 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/27 10:45] <triveni> u r d one sending me logs..i have to remembr bringing ur stuff..
[06/27 10:45] <06Amit_ZOS> me getting coffee too
[06/27 10:45] <triveni> desperate times ;)
[06/27 10:45] <triveni> Thanks Amit!!
[06/27 10:45] <dsk_hbe> it is also the touchiest... I actually helped my neigbors fix an issue with their home alarm system via irc... they kept having their alarm system go off and one day I told them the second their system went off, my irc had dropped... if it thinks the power has lapsed it is very touchy.  So they were able to figure out that they had thei alarm system set up incorrectly, with their backdoor setting where the power failure setting should hav
[06/27 10:46] <triveni> ohh
[06/27 10:46] <triveni> interesting 
[06/27 10:46] <triveni> ;)
[06/27 10:46] <dsk_hbe> touchy app ;-)
[06/27 10:47] <triveni> heehe
[06/27 10:51] <JimE_zOS> I'd call that "sophisticated", not "touchy".  
[06/27 10:51] <JimE_zOS> if it can diagnose an alarm system problem in somebody else's house, that is a ZEUS application. 
[06/27 10:52] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[06/27 10:53] <triveni> My words will be "interesting app" ;)
[06/27 10:53] <triveni> heeheh D
[06/27 10:53] <triveni> :D
[06/27 10:53] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[06/27 11:04] <triveni> P5 ticket
[06/27 11:04] <06Amit_ZOS> ok, the doc's still bad, nw can someone tell me how to dupe a ticket?
[06/27 11:04] <triveni> space abend
[06/27 11:04] <triveni> SE37
[06/27 11:05] <dsk_hbe> you want to create a ticket and dup it to an older ticket, Amit?
[06/27 11:05] <triveni> is it ours..
[06/27 11:06] <06Amit_ZOS> isn't that what charlie suggested?
[06/27 11:06] <dsk_hbe> from what I read in the email we got, Triveni, Vickie Beener sent it to us becasue she doesn't have authority to do what is needed
[06/27 11:06] <triveni> ok
[06/27 11:07] <dsk_hbe> I have no idea what Charlie does with these... not sure what to tell you there.  If that is what you are wanting to do I suggest creating the ticket first and then when you go to resolve it you choose dup from the list of resolve actions.
[06/27 11:07] <dsk_hbe> the 'resolve code' list... ahd to go look and see where it was
[06/27 11:08] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> look at the ticket that charlie guy previously created for that doc, and do the same thing
[06/27 11:08] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> :)
[06/27 11:09] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> dont dup it anywhere
[06/27 11:09] <triveni> that job i don't see the failed run in a.s.s in sysw
[06/27 11:09] <triveni> it shows all good runs rc=0
[06/27 11:09] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> just refer to it in the ticket description
[06/27 11:09] <dsk_hbe> give me a few minutes, Triveni... it's a priority 5 so I haven't looked... it can wait a few
[06/27 11:10] <triveni> ok debbie
[06/27 11:10] <06Amit_ZOS> that old one has a webstar associated with it.. do i need a new webstar as well?
[06/27 11:11] <triveni> i missed irc logs.. but m guessing..amit you found a faulty doc.. and u r creating a ticket for that doc..
[06/27 11:11] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> no, because when you create it, it will automagically assign it to fab support
[06/27 11:12] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> but duplicate all the stuff from the previous ticket: incluing the severity levels and the ci
[06/27 11:12] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> and you can use the same description
[06/27 11:12] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> just add the reference to the prior ticket
[06/27 11:12] <triveni> amit wen u r done..gimme the ticket no..whichever u ll create.. i ll have a look too..
[06/27 11:13] <JimE_zOS> is this the Vickie ticket? 
[06/27 11:13] <JimE_zOS> because Brian Briggs was already involved, I think 
[06/27 11:13] <triveni> the p5 ticket..yes its vickie's
[06/27 11:13] <triveni> it says so..
[06/27 11:13] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> no, amit is talking about the bad doc ticket
[06/27 11:13] <JimE_zOS> so if Brian already knows and it ended up here, FabSup might not be able to help. 
[06/27 11:14] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> the vickie ticket is something different
[06/27 11:14] <JimE_zOS> k...I'm going to take teh Vickie ticket. 
[06/27 11:14] <triveni> jim
[06/27 11:14] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 11:15] <triveni> i want to know too
[06/27 11:15] <triveni> am trying to find it in savrs
[06/27 11:15] <triveni> i see only good runs there.
[06/27 11:15] <06Amit_ZOS> can i just add the old ticket reference in the short description?
[06/27 11:16] <JimE_zOS> step off!  We'll get there. 
[06/27 11:16] <triveni> ok..
[06/27 11:16] <JimE_zOS> let me look around a bit and then we'll talk. 
[06/27 11:16] <triveni> I am the elf.. if you have seen harry potter or read it... here to help.. so please do use me..
[06/27 11:16] <triveni> sure..
[06/27 11:16] <JimE_zOS> but you can't work two tickets at teh same time on one channel. 
[06/27 11:17] <triveni> hahaaha
[06/27 11:17] <JimE_zOS> so let's get Charlie's issue managed first. 
[06/27 11:17] <triveni> ok
[06/27 11:17] <triveni> got it
[06/27 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> im almost there
[06/27 11:17] <JimE_zOS> because he needs to LEAVE 
[06/27 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> im putting the old tick num in short description and related records both
[06/27 11:17] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> lol triveni with the HP reference
[06/27 11:17] <JimE_zOS> not a related record. 
[06/27 11:18] <triveni> ;)
[06/27 11:18] <JimE_zOS> related records belong to the same incident. 
[06/27 11:18] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> i think that charlie guy is reading a book about turing
[06/27 11:18] <JimE_zOS> you have a similar record, not a related one. 
[06/27 11:18] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> "the annotated turing" by charles petzold
[06/27 11:18] <triveni> wow
[06/27 11:18] <triveni> heheeh
[06/27 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> Fabrication Support- L1 (LNG) ---assigned
[06/27 11:19] <06Amit_ZOS> not puttin in related records
[06/27 11:19] <triveni> oh the movie.. i think its enigma.. charlie..
[06/27 11:20] <triveni> sorry the device name was that..
[06/27 11:21] <triveni> and there is movie..named the imitation game..the latest one on this..
[06/27 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> INC01572760 is created btw
[06/27 11:25] <triveni> Yo amit!!
[06/27 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> you'r free to discuss elves', movies, or tickets!
[06/27 11:25] <triveni> heeheh
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> Good Job amit..
[06/27 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> Although you know what, its priority 5! while charlies was 2
[06/27 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> :X
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> next time i want to know hwo to do this duplication stuff..
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> i ll come to you 
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> i was just asking 
[06/27 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> its not duped
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> whats going on
[06/27 11:27] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> That's why i said you had to duplicate the priorities also
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> and you were working on it..
[06/27 11:27] <triveni> u could easily deal with p2
[06/27 11:28] <triveni> u r a champ!!
[06/27 11:28] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> you can fix that 
[06/27 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> how?
[06/27 11:29] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> impact->high, urgency->medium
[06/27 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> Thank you
[06/27 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/27 11:29] <Not_the_droid_youre_seeking> if you dont set those, the priority will be 5, and it needs to be at least a 2
[06/27 11:32] <JimE_zOS> brb
[06/27 11:42] <JimE_zOS> back 
[06/27 11:50] <JimE_zOS> Triveni?  Do you have an IEBCOPY job someplace? 
[06/27 11:50] <triveni> no but i can find one
[06/27 11:50] <triveni> from urs or charlie's library
[06/27 11:50] <triveni> writing from scratch would be a lenghty process
[06/27 11:50] <JimE_zOS> I think it is only reasonable for us to give you JCL for homegrown tools. 
[06/27 11:51] <JimE_zOS> but for standard utilities, I want to make sure you understand how to set-up the job. 
[06/27 11:51] <triveni> you want me to write it
[06/27 11:51] <triveni> i can do that
[06/27 11:51] <JimE_zOS> write or find....don't care. 
[06/27 11:51] <JimE_zOS> but I don't want to just give you standard utility JCL. 
[06/27 11:51] <JimE_zOS> (unless we are in a hurry...which we aren't)
[06/27 11:52] <triveni> ok
[06/27 11:52] <triveni> ok
[06/27 11:52] <triveni> i know the job
[06/27 11:52] <triveni> i have used it earlier
[06/27 11:52] <triveni> ok
[06/27 11:55] <JimE_zOS> while U R working, I'll point out that I have a conference call at noon so we'll take a break until I get done.  Again...we aren't in a hurry so I think that is OK. 
[06/27 11:57] <triveni> ok
[06/27 12:24] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey debbie, 
[06/27 12:25] <dsk_hbe> yes sir?
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> btw i ran your jobs yesterday, but they didnt seem to return any records
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAXU J061527
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAXU J063791
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAXU J064269
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> did i miss something?
[06/27 12:25] <dsk_hbe> my jobs?  the user report?  sec, I'll look
[06/27 12:25] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe> yep... I ran one too... remember how I told you that eclipse searching is kind of odd?  I know, for example, that that user was runnign one of their searches yesterday when daily processing failed due to this:
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe> * 063154 0306 AB-P0RKN0D,0000,69,IHOJIFMF,Q156,00D1,00,    ,SDIGPM+00B6AY**
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe> but, being that he was the third search caught in teh code trap:
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe>  063143 0306 AB-P74KSP0,0000,69,IHOJIFGG,Q156,00D1,00,    ,SDIGPM+00B6AY01
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe>  063153 0306 AB-P47MRZB,0000,69,IHOJIFMC,Q156,00D1,00,    ,SDIGPM+00B6AY**
[06/27 12:28] <dsk_hbe>  063154 0306 AB-P0RKN0D,0000,69,IHOJIFMF,Q156,00D1,00,    ,SDIGPM+00B6AY**
[06/27 12:29] <dsk_hbe> * 063154 0367 ECL DAILY PROCESSING RECURSIVE ABENDS ERROR*****
[06/27 12:29] <dsk_hbe> all he got was a 'D' lock.  We only give the first two the OCS lock 'OD'.  and in that processing we also don't write the search's monitor stat.
[06/27 12:29] <dsk_hbe> it's just how eclipse daily processing works.
[06/27 12:30] <dsk_hbe> in fact, in checkign it looks like we don't write out the monitor record for any of those three failed searches.
[06/27 12:31] <dsk_hbe> Three being the trigger for how many we allow before shutting down daily processing
[06/27 12:33] <06Amit_ZOS> ok, so what i understand is that eclipse was involved in all the abends with our guy in it.. so since there was no issues which is not eclipse related with our guy in it, we returned 0 records
[06/27 12:33] <dsk_hbe> wow, let me re-read that sentence a few more times and see if I get what you are trying to say
[06/27 12:34] <dsk_hbe> meantime, go look at this job... this is for a user who ran some successful eclipse searches yesterday... so you can see what they look like... very different from a live session - JOB(UKAMBDSU,41210)
[06/27 12:35] <dsk_hbe> and I have reread your sentence multiple times and don't follow what you are trying to say.
[06/27 12:35] <dsk_hbe> let me try to summarize myself.
[06/27 12:37] <dsk_hbe> 0RKN0D has an eclipse search in NEWS;ALLNWS.  that lib;file is the one that is currently causing eclipse daily processign to fail, so when we hit that user's search it will always fail and has been for a few days.  However, since, so far, he has not been the first or second search to be hit with the news;allnws issue during a daily processing run, it will not be locked and can still run the next day.  After seeing him consume so very much
[06/27 12:37] <dsk_hbe> CPU for a couple days, Wayne asked me to have the search locked.  I asked OPS to do that priori to seeign your email so he is now out of the picture.
[06/27 12:41] <06Amit_ZOS> i see.. and since 0RKN0D came up in one of the failed searches which doesnt go into the monitor, we don't see anything in the output is it?
[06/27 12:41] <06Amit_ZOS> output of our job that is
[06/27 12:42] <dsk_hbe> correct... apparently we only write output to the monitor for user report data if the search succeeded
[06/27 12:43] <06Amit_ZOS> good
[06/27 12:43] <dsk_hbe> I've got a bunch of windows locking up here... in case I go away 
[06/27 12:43] <06Amit_ZOS> the one you just gave me, u ran it on 7P1JSZ right?
[06/27 12:43] <06Amit_ZOS> and since he did not hit NEWS;ALLNEWS, it did not fail
[06/27 12:44] <dsk_hbe> right
[06/27 12:44] <06Amit_ZOS> although he did try NEWS;BUSINESS
[06/27 12:44] <06Amit_ZOS> great
[06/27 12:44] <06Amit_ZOS> i understand it little better now..
[06/27 12:44] <dsk_hbe> yep, but a totally different list of databases involved there so he didn't hit the MFR issue in the code
[06/27 12:45] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 12:45] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks debbie!
[06/27 12:45] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[06/27 12:45] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[06/27 12:45] <06Amit_ZOS> so that job gives us the DB a user searches and the search string itself right?
[06/27 12:46] <06Amit_ZOS> any other info from that output?
[06/27 12:47] <dsk_hbe> the user report?  for eclipse it smushes all of the info into just one record... no database, but library;file, the menu; the search name is in there, the actual search string (though I think it gets truncated.
[06/27 12:48] <06Amit_ZOS> thought so
[06/27 12:48] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/27 12:48] <06Amit_ZOS> search name?
[06/27 12:48] <06Amit_ZOS> oh you mean "ECLIPSE"?
[06/27 12:48] <dsk_hbe> no, sec
[06/27 12:49] <dsk_hbe> look at this job... it is a dump of all eclipses on the classic eclipse file.  The first one you see in the user report is the first one in this jobs' report - JOB(UKAMBDSE,181506)  There you have headers so you can see what is what in the user report.
[06/27 12:50] <dsk_hbe> for example, search name is 'KNW - COMP1'
[06/27 12:51] <dsk_hbe> I will warn you like I warned Triveni... Classic Eclipse isn't worth you learnign too much about.  I won't be surprised if Eric gets the ok to shut it down completely.
[06/27 12:53] * triveni has joined #theRock
[06/27 12:53] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[06/27 12:55] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 12:55] <06Amit_ZOS> the user report generates only an eclipse report is it?
[06/27 12:55] <dsk_hbe> no, it can be used for any user doing research in Classic, so still usefull beyond Eclipse
[06/27 12:56] <dsk_hbe> sec, I'll find you someone to run a user report against
[06/27 12:56] <dsk_hbe> try this user ID - FNZ4CB
[06/27 12:57] <dsk_hbe> I got him off of this abline from yesterday - * 132300 0406 AB-PFNZ4CB,0007,24,IHOMGEOB,9861,03D6,00,@@@@,DWSMGR+008E6T**
[06/27 12:58] <06Amit_ZOS> from PE00.LPAED.MONITOR.DAILY?
[06/27 12:58] <06Amit_ZOS> from yesterday
[06/27 12:58] <06Amit_ZOS> so yes
[06/27 12:59] <dsk_hbe> yes
[06/27 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[06/27 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAXU J055334
[06/27 13:01] <06Amit_ZOS> i have it
[06/27 13:01] <dsk_hbe> so you can kind of get an idea of what they were doing in their session.
[06/27 13:02] <06Amit_ZOS> date, time, search level, num of documents, module, search units(not populated)
[06/27 13:02] <dsk_hbe> and around when that abline was you can see they were trying to retrieve a huge number of hits
[06/27 13:02] <06Amit_ZOS> whats REPLY?
[06/27 13:03] <dsk_hbe> we won't go into all that detail, Amit.  Here again you won't use this often since no billables are on Classic.  How about we just address the detail when/if it becomes necessary?
[06/27 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> CURRENT SEARCH LEVEL:     1        NUMBER DOCUMENTS:      1,263,134
[06/27 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[06/27 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. so this was a classic search
[06/27 13:04] <dsk_hbe> reply is where the user entered something... but we woudl need to teach you all of the commands... like C means change file... it's a complexity that is a waste of your time right now.
[06/27 13:04] <dsk_hbe> Id bet you'd never need it.
[06/27 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[06/27 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[06/27 13:04] <dsk_hbe> yes, classic search/browse/etc
[06/27 13:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks a ton debbie
[06/27 13:05] <dsk_hbe> before I even looked it up, I just knew this ID belonged to a Manila person and sure enough... they are notorious for running searches that retrieve a ton of docs
[06/27 13:05] <dsk_hbe> you are welcome!
[06/27 13:06] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. will be back after lunch
[06/27 13:06] <dsk_hbe> ok!

[06/27 13:09] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[06/27 13:09] <triveni> Jim.. i have the job..
[06/27 13:09] <triveni> i tested it too
[06/27 13:09] <dsk_hbe> is it just irc or your entire VPN connection?
[06/27 13:10] <triveni> here the net z slow
[06/27 13:10] <triveni> dats the problm
[06/27 13:11] <triveni> and its raining
[06/27 13:11] <triveni> and its a small town..so network issues..
[06/27 13:11] <triveni> so sometimes my vpn troubles me.. and sometimes irc also..
[06/27 13:11] <triveni> i would blame it on the vpn..
[06/27 13:18] <JimE_zOS> k...back from concall. 
[06/27 13:18] <JimE_zOS> k....you have an IEBCOPY job...excellent. 
[06/27 13:19] <JimE_zOS> so let's talk about some of the details. 
[06/27 13:19] <JimE_zOS> first of all, this dataset lives on DBO021...which is a 3380 
[06/27 13:19] <JimE_zOS> most of our volumes are 3390 geometry, but this one is older. 
[06/27 13:20] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:20] <triveni> can i open the dataset 
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> and it makes a difference in the SPACE attributes you use. 
[06/27 13:20] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> k...we'll get there. 
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> I've checked the volume and there is plenty of space: 
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> Free Space   Tracks
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> Size  . . :  33,058
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> Largest . :  30,923
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> Free               
[06/27 13:20] <JimE_zOS> Extents . :     230
[06/27 13:20] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:21] <triveni> what's the problem?
[06/27 13:21] <triveni> its failing when they are copying it?
[06/27 13:21] <JimE_zOS> had the volume been full, we'd have had to consider some clean-up
[06/27 13:21] <JimE_zOS> the dataset if FULL, not the volume that holds the dataset
[06/27 13:21] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:21] <JimE_zOS> meaning there is room for us to grow the dataset 
[06/27 13:21] <triveni> can't we compress it
[06/27 13:22] <JimE_zOS> perhaps...
[06/27 13:22] <JimE_zOS> but we have x37 support enabled. 
[06/27 13:23] <JimE_zOS> so a typical "out of space" situation would be handled automatically
[06/27 13:23] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:24] <JimE_zOS> it is PO, not POE 
[06/27 13:24] <triveni> yeah i was just checking
[06/27 13:25] <JimE_zOS> so we can certainly try compress.  I was just going to enlarge the dataset 
[06/27 13:25] <triveni> a z
[06/27 13:25] <triveni> "z"
[06/27 13:25] <triveni> will that work
[06/27 13:25] <JimE_zOS> oh, no...we aren't going to do that...EVER 
[06/27 13:25] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:25] <JimE_zOS> the problem with those is that if the compress fails, you have no dataset backup 
[06/27 13:26] <triveni> ohh
[06/27 13:26] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:26] <JimE_zOS> so you've lost the contents of our dataset. 
[06/27 13:26] <triveni> so we will enlarge it via a job
[06/27 13:26] <JimE_zOS> handy thing, but not acceptable for production datasets. 
[06/27 13:26] <JimE_zOS> we are going to do this: 
[06/27 13:26] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:27] <JimE_zOS> 1) copy the existing contents to a new, larger dataset.  The dataset name will be a PZ00, not PI00. 
[06/27 13:27] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:27] <JimE_zOS> 2) we'll compare the datasets to make sure they are identical. 
[06/27 13:28] <JimE_zOS> 3) we'll rename the datasets so we have the original content EXACTLY as we found it for backup and questions. 
[06/27 13:28] <triveni> ohh
[06/27 13:28] <JimE_zOS> 4) the new dataset will be larger (and compressed by default) 
[06/27 13:28] <triveni> so its mainly copying it
[06/27 13:28] <JimE_zOS> and renaming, but yes, 
[06/27 13:28] <triveni> got it 
[06/27 13:29] <JimE_zOS> so....let me see your DD statement for the new dataset, please. 
[06/27 13:29] <triveni> yeah that's what i was thinking
[06/27 13:30] <triveni> lemme think and i ll share
[06/27 13:30] <JimE_zOS> k...sure 
[06/27 13:30] <triveni> jim they have already copied to a new one
[06/27 13:30] <triveni> in the ticket
[06/27 13:30] <triveni> they tried copying
[06/27 13:30] <triveni> not sure it went great or not
[06/27 13:31] <JimE_zOS> "those people" don't start with somebody else's leftovers.  
[06/27 13:31] <triveni> yes..
[06/27 13:31] <JimE_zOS> no idea what they did or how right it is. 
[06/27 13:31] <triveni> agreed!!
[06/27 13:32] <JimE_zOS> so not interested in their dataset.  I do, of course, care about their experience and what I can learn from it. 
[06/27 13:32] <JimE_zOS> but I'm not taking some unknown dataset and betting my reputation on the fact that it is right. 
[06/27 13:34] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:39] <triveni> jim i can give a number which will be greater than 1192 i.e. (primary+secondary trks)
[06/27 13:39] <triveni> but there used to be a way where depending on the number of records we can give space
[06/27 13:40] <triveni> if we are going on safe side i can just arbitarily pick something like 1200..
[06/27 13:40] <triveni> for being on safe side
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS> are we looking at teh same dataset? 
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS> Current Utilization         
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS>  Used tracks . . . . : 1,999
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS>  Used extents  . . . : 16   
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS>  Used dir. blocks  . : 51   
[06/27 13:41] <JimE_zOS>  Number of members . : 1,064
[06/27 13:41] <triveni> PI00.LPA5B.BLISS.NORM.RULE.SETS
[06/27 13:41] <triveni> Used tracks . . . . :,1,104
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> Used extents  . . . :,1
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> Used dir. blocks  . :,51
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> Number of members . :,1,064
[06/27 13:42] <JimE_zOS> so where did you get 1192? 
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> 1st extent tracks . :,1104
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> Secondary tracks  . :,88
[06/27 13:42] <JimE_zOS> what system are you on? 
[06/27 13:42] <triveni> i just clubbed these two
[06/27 13:43] <triveni> sysw
[06/27 13:43] <JimE_zOS> that's the problem. 
[06/27 13:43] <JimE_zOS> where did the jobs fail? 
[06/27 13:43] <triveni> in ticket it said so
[06/27 13:43] <triveni> job failed on sysw
[06/27 13:44] <JimE_zOS> nope. 
[06/27 13:44] <triveni> DescriptionLMS job failed on sysW UBEENVLC IEC032I E37-
[06/27 13:44] <JimE_zOS> nope. 
[06/27 13:44] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:44] <JimE_zOS> the job is in spool on SYSW, but if you look at it, it failed on the internal cluster. 
[06/27 13:44] <triveni> what m i missing
[06/27 13:44] <triveni> ohh
[06/27 13:45] <JimE_zOS> and in case I forget to say this, NEVER believe what people tell you. 
[06/27 13:45] <JimE_zOS> most people are stupid. 
[06/27 13:45] <triveni> ohh ok
[06/27 13:45] <JimE_zOS> VERIFY EVERYTHING 
[06/27 13:45] <triveni> how did u know this
[06/27 13:45] <triveni> u checked spool
[06/27 13:45] <JimE_zOS> that's how you get a reputation like mine....nasty to work with but things almost always work. 
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> jim.. i couldn't find any errored out job in sysw spool
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> in a.s.s
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> they were all good runs
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> in savrs
[06/27 13:46] <JimE_zOS> a.s.s isn't spool.  That is SAVRS
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> did u check in iof
[06/27 13:46] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:46] <JimE_zOS> the job is actually on spool. 
[06/27 13:46] <JimE_zOS> so use IOF to find it. 
[06/27 13:47] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:48] <triveni> looking into it
[06/27 13:48] <JimE_zOS> see these: 
[06/27 13:48] <JimE_zOS> ../*ROUTE PRINT DCW   
[06/27 13:48] <JimE_zOS> ../*ROUTE XEQ DCC     
[06/27 13:49] <JimE_zOS> (I added the .. so IRC wouldn't think those are commands)
[06/27 13:49] <triveni> i also saw sysg
[06/27 13:49] <JimE_zOS> difference between ROUTE XEQ and actual execution note. 
[06/27 13:49] <JimE_zOS> node, even. 
[06/27 13:50] <JimE_zOS> ROUTE XEQ means "run this job on that JES2 node" 
[06/27 13:50] <JimE_zOS> and node, internal cluster, actually has four systems: A, C, G and J. 
[06/27 13:50] <JimE_zOS> so ROUTE XEQ DCC can get you to any of those systems. 
[06/27 13:50] <JimE_zOS> generally identical. 
[06/27 13:50] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:51] <triveni> so always route xeq means internal cluster jobs
[06/27 13:51] <JimE_zOS> there are a few program products that only run on SYSA and some that only run on SYSG, but more or less identical. 
[06/27 13:51] <JimE_zOS> no, I could ROUTE XEQ DCI 
[06/27 13:51] <triveni> i ll remembe that
[06/27 13:51] <triveni> oh
[06/27 13:51] <JimE_zOS> which would run the job on Cluster 1 (either SYSI or SYSL) 
[06/27 13:52] <JimE_zOS> but the point here is that we need to look at teh job output and figure out where the thing actually ran, which might not be where the job output finally lands. 
[06/27 13:52] <triveni> okk
[06/27 13:53] <JimE_zOS> and once we realize that teh job ran on the internal cluster, an entirely different dataset is involved. 
[06/27 13:53] <JimE_zOS> same DSN, but two completely seperate datasets. 
[06/27 13:54] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:54] <JimE_zOS> so we are back to SPACE values 
[06/27 13:55] <JimE_zOS> we are currently using 1999 tracks (from above pasted output) 
[06/27 13:55] <triveni> not got the part why the comments
[06/27 13:55] <triveni> right?
[06/27 13:55] <triveni> but how did they get executed..
[06/27 13:55] <JimE_zOS> you lost me.  
[06/27 13:55] <triveni> they are comments as per Jcl
[06/27 13:56] <JimE_zOS> what is a comment? 
[06/27 13:56] <triveni> who is executing those lines?
[06/27 13:56] <JimE_zOS> the ROUTE XEQ and ROUTE PRINT ? 
[06/27 13:56] <JimE_zOS> those are directives to JES2 
[06/27 13:56] <triveni> yeah
[06/27 13:56] <triveni> ohh
[06/27 13:56] <JimE_zOS> the job was originated on SYSW. 
[06/27 13:57] <JimE_zOS> so JES2 on SYSW looks at the JCL and realizes (due to the ROUTE XEQ) that the job needs to go to a remote system for execution. 
[06/27 13:57] <triveni> and the directives helped
[06/27 13:57] <triveni> got it
[06/27 13:57] <JimE_zOS> so JES2 on SYSW forwards the JCL to the internal cluster 
[06/27 13:58] <JimE_zOS> I think, in this shop, everything routes via the internal cluster. 
[06/27 13:58] <triveni> ok
[06/27 13:58] <JimE_zOS> it doesn't matter the details on routing, exactly, just realize that teh job ran someplace else. 
[06/27 13:58] <JimE_zOS> k...so SPACE 
[06/27 13:59] <JimE_zOS> we are using 1999 tracks and 51 directory blocks. 
[06/27 13:59] <JimE_zOS> so, I suggest our new dataset be 3000 tracks and 80 directory blocks. 
[06/27 13:59] <triveni> Used tracks . . . . :,1,999
[06/27 13:59] <triveni> Used extents  . . . :,16
[06/27 13:59] <triveni> Used dir. blocks  . :,51
[06/27 13:59] <triveni> Number of members . :,1,064
[06/27 13:59] <triveni> yes
[06/27 14:00] <triveni> i agree!!
[06/27 14:00] <JimE_zOS> it varies by content, but since we are using 25-ish directory blocks per 1000 tracks, and we are adding 1000 tracks, we need to add 25-ish more directory blocks. 
[06/27 14:00] <JimE_zOS> I rounded up, slightly. 
[06/27 14:00] <triveni> yes makes sense
[06/27 14:00] <JimE_zOS> k...now the DCB attributes. 
[06/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> our datasets (especially online) have weird DCB attributes. 
[06/27 14:01] <triveni> we can leave that
[06/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> and we need to make sure we HONOR those values in every way. 
[06/27 14:01] <triveni> or do we have to specify
[06/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> around here, changing a DCB attribute....even in a subtle way, can result in failure. 
[06/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> I allowed a dataset to go into a second track one time.....BZZZZT! 
[06/27 14:02] <triveni> if we won't specify
[06/27 14:02] <triveni> won't it take the original dataset dcb values
[06/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> oh, we are going to specify everything. 
[06/27 14:02] <triveni> which we are trying to copy
[06/27 14:02] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:03] <JimE_zOS> no....the system has a habit of "helping" you and reblocking things to be efficient. 
[06/27 14:03] <JimE_zOS> efficient is nice, but working is even better. 
[06/27 14:03] <triveni> got it
[06/27 14:03] <JimE_zOS> so we are going to specify all details of the DCB 
[06/27 14:03] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[06/27 14:03] <triveni> lrecl=6090
[06/27 14:03] <JimE_zOS> wow, Amit, really?  Another 55 miles at lunch?!?  How do you do that?? :-)
[06/27 14:03] <triveni> recfm=f
[06/27 14:04] <JimE_zOS> yep
[06/27 14:04] <JimE_zOS> and blksize. 
[06/27 14:04] <JimE_zOS> so we don't get "helped" 
[06/27 14:04] <triveni> 6090
[06/27 14:04] <triveni> as the original one
[06/27 14:04] <JimE_zOS> yep, true 
[06/27 14:05] <JimE_zOS> k...and our SPACE values will be.... ? 
[06/27 14:05] <triveni> SPACE=(TRK,3000,20),
[06/27 14:05] <JimE_zOS> probably not needed (the SPACE values will get you there), but you could also specify DSORG. 
[06/27 14:05] <JimE_zOS> almost.  
[06/27 14:06] <JimE_zOS> we need to specify directory blocks too. 
[06/27 14:06] <JimE_zOS> and I think we'll bump 20 (your secondary) to 500 
[06/27 14:07] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:07] <JimE_zOS> actually, how about 495 (cylinder boundry) 
[06/27 14:08] <JimE_zOS> 15 tracks to the cyclinder 
[06/27 14:08] <triveni> we are going cylinders
[06/27 14:08] <JimE_zOS> no, tracks. 
[06/27 14:08] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:08] <JimE_zOS> but there is no point in leaving a few spare tracks here and there. 
[06/27 14:08] <triveni> 495
[06/27 14:08] <JimE_zOS> might as well allocate on a cylinder boundry
[06/27 14:09] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[06/27 14:09] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:09] <JimE_zOS> so who did we end up on directory blocks? 
[06/27 14:09] <JimE_zOS> how, that is. 
[06/27 14:10] <triveni> m trying to find how to write directory blocks
[06/27 14:10] <triveni> never tried that
[06/27 14:10] <JimE_zOS> it is part of your SPACE parm
[06/27 14:10] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:10] <JimE_zOS> SPACE=(cyl | trk | block, (primary, secondary, directory)) 
[06/27 14:11] <triveni> yes
[06/27 14:11] <JimE_zOS> and, no, I don't have the syntax diagram in my head for all of JCL. 
[06/27 14:11] <triveni> that third value is directory
[06/27 14:11] <JimE_zOS> yes, true. 
[06/27 14:11] <triveni> i remember it too now
[06/27 14:12] <triveni> dsorg will be PO
[06/27 14:12] <JimE_zOS> yes, true. 
[06/27 14:12] <JimE_zOS> POE would be dangerous around here. 
[06/27 14:13] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:13] <triveni> and volser do we have to specify
[06/27 14:13] <JimE_zOS> yep....we do. 
[06/27 14:13] <triveni> DBO021
[06/27 14:13] <triveni> as the original one
[06/27 14:13] <JimE_zOS> we want this on a very specific volume so as not to break whatever processes use this dataset. 
[06/27 14:13] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[06/27 14:14] <triveni> unit
[06/27 14:14] <JimE_zOS> DB OH - ZERO - 21.  I hate VOLSER's like that. 
[06/27 14:14] <triveni> will it be sysda
[06/27 14:14] <JimE_zOS> nope....
[06/27 14:14] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:14] <JimE_zOS> you are specifying a VOLSER, not a ESOTERIC. 
[06/27 14:15] <JimE_zOS> but you should say UNIT=SYSALLDA 
[06/27 14:15] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:15] <triveni> i think have everything now
[06/27 14:15] <JimE_zOS> k...let me see, please, your DD for the new dataset. 
[06/27 14:15] <triveni> taking a break..brb.. and i ll show u the jcl parameters..
[06/27 14:15] <JimE_zOS> k
[06/27 14:16] <triveni> gimme 10 
[06/27 14:16] <JimE_zOS> I'll be in a concall at 2:30 RE: Oracle migration.

[06/27 14:24] <triveni> am i missing anything..
[06/27 14:26] <JimE_zOS> blksize, I think
[06/27 14:26] <JimE_zOS> I usually specify DSORG as part of the DCB string, but I think what you have will work. 
[06/27 14:27] <JimE_zOS> you'll need a second ) at the end of SPACE parms.
[06/27 14:27] <JimE_zOS> and I htink it is VOL=SER=
[06/27 14:28] <JimE_zOS> and no , after DCB 
[06/27 14:28] <triveni> both works
[06/27 14:28] <triveni> but i ll go for VOL
[06/27 14:28] <JimE_zOS> what dataset name are you going to use? 
[06/27 14:28] <JimE_zOS> if VOLUME works, you can sure leave it. 
[06/27 14:29] <JimE_zOS> I'm just not familiar with the spelled out version. 
[06/27 14:29] <triveni> u attend ur meeting
[06/27 14:29] <triveni> i ll come up with something
[06/27 14:29] <JimE_zOS> I will...but we are holding up batch releases so this needs to get done. 
[06/27 14:29] <triveni> i ll show u my job
[06/27 14:29] <triveni> before i run
[06/27 14:29] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[06/27 14:29] <triveni> yeah i m gonna do it now
[06/27 14:30] <triveni> PZ00.LPA5B.BLISS.NORM.RULE.SETS
[06/27 14:30] <triveni> can i give this
[06/27 14:31] <JimE_zOS> yep...that should be fine. 
[06/27 14:40] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni, can you share the job location pls?
[06/27 14:41] <triveni> yes
[06/27 14:41] <triveni> UBANPTX.ISPF.JCLLIB(C0PYPDS)
[06/27 14:41] <triveni> am in it right now
[06/27 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> thats ok
[06/27 14:42] <06Amit_zOS> im gonna be browsing it only
[06/27 14:42] <triveni> amit my net z slow here
[06/27 14:42] <triveni> can u tell me syntax for blksize
[06/27 14:43] <triveni> rest i have 
[06/27 14:44] <06Amit_zOS> DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80,RECFM=FB)
[06/27 14:44] <06Amit_zOS> similar to that

[06/27 14:45] <triveni> just check it
[06/27 14:45] <triveni> i think it looks good
[06/27 14:45] <triveni> removed the unit which is extra
[06/27 14:46] <triveni> Jim.. please check this once UBANPTX.ISPF.JCLLIB(C0PYPDS)
[06/27 14:47] <JimE_zOS> in concall 
[06/27 14:48] <triveni> amit what do u think how it looks
[06/27 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> simple enough i think.. copies it with same content and same attributes except with a larger primary and secondary allocations
[06/27 14:58] <triveni> should i wait for jim to submit it
[06/27 14:58] <triveni> thats what i am thinking..
[06/27 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> yes you should
[06/27 14:59] <triveni> ok
[06/27 14:59] <JimE_zOS> k...back. 
[06/27 14:59] <JimE_zOS> why did you take out hte VOLUME=SYSALLDA ? 
[06/27 14:59] <triveni> just check the final job
[06/27 14:59] <06Amit_zOS> DCB can come before volser
[06/27 15:00] <JimE_zOS> these are keyworded, so order doesn't matter. 
[06/27 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> i hoped so
[06/27 15:00] <JimE_zOS> can I see your control cards. 
[06/27 15:00] <JimE_zOS> that was a question.

[06/27 15:01] <triveni> this is the final one
[06/27 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> XEQ and print parms not required in her job is it Jim?
[06/27 15:02] <triveni> we are already in internal cluster
[06/27 15:02] <JimE_zOS> depends on where she submitts the job, Amit. 
[06/27 15:02] <triveni> but i can add it
[06/27 15:02] <JimE_zOS> k..then no, they are not required. 
[06/27 15:02] <triveni> am in sysc
[06/27 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> she is in c

[06/27 15:06] <triveni> yeah
[06/27 15:06] <triveni> if we wanted to specify any member
[06/27 15:06] <triveni> we could have given in the control card
[06/27 15:06] <JimE_zOS> yes, true.

[06/27 15:08] <JimE_zOS> agree....looks fine. 
[06/27 15:08] <JimE_zOS> so...
[06/27 15:08] <triveni> so now we can rename it
[06/27 15:08] <JimE_zOS> you are going to rename the PI00 version to PI00.blah.blah.D170627 
[06/27 15:08] <triveni> should i do that
[06/27 15:08] <triveni> yeah
[06/27 15:09] <JimE_zOS> and then change teh PZ00 to PI00, right? 
[06/27 15:09] <triveni> yes

[06/27 15:15] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[06/27 15:15] <dsk_hbe> bye Triveni!
[06/27 15:17] <06Amit_zOS> btw i ran a 5k this sunday !
[06/27 15:17] <06Amit_zOS> and this long weekend, im probably clock close to about 2k miles
[06/27 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> so im planing maybe louisville, atlanta, charleston, myrtle beach and pondering if i should stretch and come through washington dc or just cut it through charlotte
[06/27 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> thats charleston SC
[06/27 15:19] <dsk_hbe> you're driving all of that in one weekend?
[06/27 15:20] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[06/27 15:21] <06Amit_zOS> friday through tuesday
[06/27 15:21] <dsk_hbe> alone?  either way... you're crazy ;-)
[06/27 15:21] <06Amit_zOS> i will have a couple of people with me!
[06/27 15:21] <dsk_hbe> I just am not a fan of that much driving.  My husband loves to drive though
[06/27 15:22] <06Amit_zOS> Cool! 
[06/27 15:22] <06Amit_zOS> Anyone here been to Charleston?
[06/27 15:22] <06Amit_zOS> that i believe is the main destination for me.. iv heard the city is beautiful
[06/27 15:22] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, McAfee update being shoved to my machine now. 
[06/27 15:23] <dsk_hbe> I have.  It is beautiful
[06/27 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[06/27 15:23] <dsk_hbe> they have ghosts ;-)
[06/27 15:24] <06Amit_zOS> really!? where??????
[06/27 15:24] <JimE_zOS> keep your mileage logs.  Triveni will need to know :-)
[06/27 15:25] <06Amit_zOS> will keep her posted!
[06/27 15:25] <dsk_hbe> they do ghost tours in a variety of ways.  We did one in a horse drawn get-up.  I think they have some that go inside buildings.  Seems I remember a prison or large jail that has the best stories
[06/27 15:25] <06Amit_zOS> really? if you recommend it, i will go for it!@
[06/27 15:26] <dsk_hbe> I think that kind of thing is very interesting, so I enjoyed it.
[06/27 15:26] <06Amit_zOS> will do
[06/27 15:41] <06Amit_zOS> Debbie, there were a few SNMSGD+0100ET today on cl02
[06/27 15:42] <06Amit_zOS> for this guy 45V0RD
[06/27 15:42] <JimE_zOS> by way of sharing, I have deleted the hold and backup copies of last week's DBD mess. 
[06/27 15:43] <JimE_zOS> BRB 
[06/27 15:43] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[06/27 15:43] <dsk_hbe> ok, Amit... how many?  if it's just a few, I can't see gettign too worried about them.
[06/27 15:45] <dsk_hbe> you can sure look up their research via smapi and see if it is similar to what Vickie was saying was the issue.  I'd suspect it is.  Not toomuch we can do abotu it.  silly user tricks
[06/27 15:45] <06Amit_zOS> 16
[06/27 15:45] <06Amit_zOS> on cl2
[06/27 15:46] <06Amit_zOS> and that was untill 12:30 pm today 
[06/27 15:48] <dsk_hbe> make sure not to double count the '##' ablines.  i.e. this is just one true abline:
[06/27 15:48] <dsk_hbe> * 084441 2006 AB-B45V0RD,0001,69,IHPEICBM,8436,0010,00,    ,SNMSGD+0100ET##
[06/27 15:48] <dsk_hbe> * 084444 2006 AB-B45V0RD,0001,69,IHPEICBM,8436,0010,00,    ,SNMSGD+0100ET01
[06/27 15:48] <dsk_hbe> see how the abend ID is the same?
[06/27 15:48] <06Amit_zOS> i counted unique dump id's
[06/27 15:48] <dsk_hbe> ok
[06/27 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> wait, 16 is 6 too many
[06/27 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> 10
[06/27 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> last 6 were just SRPBLD ones
[06/27 15:51] <dsk_hbe> ok, I still am not excited enough to stop what I am doing ;-)
[06/27 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> i looked up smapi and they didnt show up under error records
[06/27 15:51] <dsk_hbe> if Charlie was havign you look for something special go right ahead
[06/27 15:52] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie? no.. i don't recollect him asking me to look for anything
[06/27 15:52] <06Amit_zOS> anyway.. i will leave it at that.. will see tomorrow if its anything out of the ordinary
[06/27 15:53] <dsk_hbe> ok, if it's nothing huge and definitely one user retrying doesn't exciet me, then I don't think we have time to dig into every abline we take.  sounds good

[06/28 10:57] <triveni> debbie..
[06/28 10:57] <triveni> i wanted to compare the recf and soddata
[06/28 10:57] <triveni> datasets
[06/28 10:57] <triveni> lpasa and lrisa
[06/28 10:57] <triveni> but they are pL00
[06/28 10:58] <triveni> will it be a problm if i run a compare on them
[06/28 11:00] <dsk_hbe> not at all... that's what I do when checking your change
[06/28 11:00] <triveni> okk
[06/28 11:00] <triveni> so u checked it alreadyd
[06/28 11:00] <triveni> great
[06/28 11:01] <dsk_hbe> I did, yes, but I woudl recommend that you always do that yourself when prepping
[06/28 11:01] <triveni> sure debbie..
[06/28 11:01] <triveni> what do u look for generally
[06/28 11:01] <triveni> inside it
[06/28 11:01] <dsk_hbe> with the compare?  just that your change is there and nothing else was oopsed and changed.
[06/28 11:02] <dsk_hbe> I use 3.12 and compare via pl00.lrisa.recf(*)... that compares all members of the dataset... then on the second screen enter the prod pl00.lpasa.recf
[06/28 11:03] <triveni> yeah
[06/28 11:03] <triveni> i used 3.12
[06/28 11:03] <JimE_zOS> you can also use the COMPARE job (in the F-Card source dataset) 
[06/28 11:04] <dsk_hbe> in Vickie's meeting...fyi, zlfd release has been moved to 7/13
[06/28 11:06] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee and some steps.  Back shortly.

[06/28 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> at 9:46 today 91T20S gave us 32 IOPROCS, you think the guy was trying to do things too quickly?
[06/28 12:01] <dsk_hbe> are they all for teh same tuid?  If so, likely just one pig search
[06/28 12:02] <06Amit_zOS> yup
[06/28 12:02] <06Amit_zOS> a pig search
[06/28 12:03] <dsk_hbe> oink
[06/28 12:03] <06Amit_zOS> and these don't show up as error records in smapi do they? they'r just key events?
[06/28 12:04] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... I can't recall... I usually just look for the ker so I can go find them in qsrch records.  I guess it depends on how badly they abort
[06/28 12:04] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[06/28 12:05] <dsk_hbe> if you change your smapi filter to rectype of 14, that will single him out.
[06/28 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> rectype?
[06/28 12:06] <dsk_hbe> right above the submit button
[06/28 12:07] <dsk_hbe> choose 14-Error
[06/28 12:07] <06Amit_zOS> oh C++ browser

[06/28 12:15] <dsk_hbe> I can send you my screen scrape if you need it?
[06/28 12:16] <06Amit_zOS> nah, i was just curious .. thanks though.. i don't know why mine wont show
[06/28 12:17] <dsk_hbe> gonna send you this then... want to make sure you can use this tool ok... it is oh so very helpful

[06/28 12:17] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks!
[06/28 12:21] <06Amit_zOS> i didn't know there were two flavours of dimestore one that shows search string and one that does'nt
[06/28 12:22] <06Amit_zOS> can see em now
[06/28 12:22] <dsk_hbe> it's not a different dimestore, it's just that this app has two different modes of access, the secure one giving you the ability to see more data in the dimestore
[06/28 12:23] <dsk_hbe> you shodul still have gotten the record not using the secure server
[06/28 12:23] <06Amit_zOS> yes i understand

[06/29 10:07] <JimE_zOS> back. 
[06/29 10:07] <JimE_zOS> had to drop for a meeting. 
[06/29 10:17] <dsk_hbe> this is comforting from PSA turnover - INC01574756: Aset server cannot connect to Oracle 12C in cdc12 - cpc22692
[06/29 10:20] <triveni> will it affect any of our jobs
[06/29 10:20] <dsk_hbe> no
[06/29 10:20] <triveni> ok
[06/29 10:21] <dsk_hbe> just commenting on it as that is the Oracle upgrade coming to PROD in July
[06/29 10:22] <triveni> ok
[06/29 10:22] <triveni> understood
[06/29 10:35] <JimE_zOS> the people doing the SDS stuff had considered nothing, BTW 
[06/29 10:36] <JimE_zOS> didn't know the flow, didn't think about other metadata, didn't think about fallback, didn't consider the changes needed to the OPC flow.  Nohting 
[06/29 10:36] <JimE_zOS> not our finest hour. 
[06/29 10:36] <dsk_hbe> :-(  such an important piece :-(
[06/29 10:36] <JimE_zOS> in the MDC days, this person would have found themselves reorged into a new role by end of day. 
[06/29 10:37] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I'm insisting on a metadata content freeze. 
[06/29 10:37] <JimE_zOS> so even teh SDS content is frozen and the only thing changing is the backend DB. 
[06/29 10:37] <dsk_hbe> I bet no one else would have thought to do that :-(
[06/29 10:38] <JimE_zOS> I'm also insisting on a complete end-to-end run of the SDS flow as part of implementation. 
[06/29 10:38] <JimE_zOS> I spent about 2 hours yesterday reminding myself how it all works. 
[06/29 10:39] <JimE_zOS> I probably should convert it to use UNVCMD rather than SSH. 
[06/29 10:39] <dsk_hbe> thsi is why I'll be following you out the door the day you quit this place :-}
[06/29 10:39] <JimE_zOS> :-)
[06/29 10:39] <JimE_zOS> work buddies for life! 
[06/29 10:39] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[06/29 10:40] <JimE_zOS> oh, and "Howdy". 
[06/29 10:40] <dsk_hbe> howdy :-)
[06/29 10:40] <JimE_zOS> I sort of started right in on the state of SDS and skipped my greeting. 
[06/29 10:41] <06Amit_zOS> oh guys.. sheesh! stop it .. im gonna cry!
[06/29 10:41] <JimE_zOS> I'll also point out that one of the groups on the phone was giving a little push back on the July 15th date. 
[06/29 10:41] <JimE_zOS> he wanted this moved to the August MMW
[06/29 10:42] <JimE_zOS> you laugh, but when you share a paniced phone call with a co-worker at 02:00, it forms a bond. 
[06/29 10:42] <JimE_zOS> one time, Debbie and I were on a crisis call for about 3 days (on and off) when the GMT changes went into production. 
[06/29 10:42] <dsk_hbe> ain't that the truth
[06/29 10:43] <dsk_hbe> ugh, you made me shake with that reminder, Jim :-(
[06/29 10:43] <06Amit_zOS> im sure it does! im just thinking if you two walk out, what in god's name will i be doing at 2AM!?
[06/29 10:43] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie will have his hands full with Triveni!
[06/29 10:44] <dsk_hbe> LOL, and now you understand why I follow Jim out ;-)
[06/29 10:44] <JimE_zOS> George (OPC admin) claims that he is leaving 2 weeks BEFORE Doug does :-)
[06/29 10:45] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[06/29 10:45] <triveni> lol
[06/29 10:46] <triveni> I am anyways one of Jim's disciple.. :))
[06/29 10:47] <triveni> Will always follow his lead ;)
[06/29 10:47] <JimE_zOS> it didn't occur to me to do this, but perhaps we should walk through the SDS/Rosetta flow. 
[06/29 10:48] <triveni> sure..
[06/29 10:48] <dsk_hbe> it certainly woudln't hurt me to see that, though I am certain you have shared with us oldies many times
[06/29 10:48] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure we have walked through it, yes, but I sure don't remember when. 
[06/29 10:49] <JimE_zOS> it wasn't hard to work through it yesterday afternoon, but I know where to look. 
[06/29 10:49] <triveni> our calendar is all urs.. whenever u have time..
[06/29 10:50] <JimE_zOS> we'll do it right around the move to Oracle 12 so it is fresh in everyone's mind. 
[06/29 10:50] <dsk_hbe> thanks, Jim
[06/29 10:51] <JimE_zOS> batch -> FABC -> PROD -> cert 
[06/29 10:51] <JimE_zOS> it has lots of moving pieces. 
[06/29 10:51] <JimE_zOS> and no documentation, of course. 
[06/29 10:51] <JimE_zOS> I built the flow based on discussions in a meeting. 
[06/29 10:52] <JimE_zOS> I never did get any doc. 
[06/29 10:53] <JimE_zOS> as I recall, built it during the week (because the roll-out just had to stay on schedule) and watched it run from Cleveland at 02:00. 
[06/29 10:53] <JimE_zOS> worked perfectly the first time.  
[06/29 10:53] <dsk_hbe> he's amazing
[06/29 10:53] <JimE_zOS> Dave W was oncall 
[06/29 10:53] <JimE_zOS> long time ago. 
[06/29 10:53] <triveni> thanks jim

[06/30 14:49] <triveni> but u r the best u know
[06/30 14:49] <dsk_hbe> wise, they were saying on the news last night that today's afternoon traffic will be the worst of the weekend

[06/30 14:50] <triveni> yeah its the long weekend
[06/30 14:50] <triveni> everyone is flying somewhere
[06/30 14:51] <dsk_hbe> they also claimed more people would be driving than flying... I guess that makes sense almost any time though ;-)

[07/05 09:31] <02charlie> morning debbie
[07/05 09:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Morning Debbie!
[07/05 09:32] <06Amit_ZOS> I see you had a busy weekend! 
[07/05 09:33] <dsk_hbe> never a dull moment around here ;-)
[07/05 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> evidently!
[07/05 09:34] <02charlie> and thanks again, debbie
[07/05 09:35] <dsk_hbe> I hope the folks workign the hourly spike issue resolve something soon, but Rita's last email doesn't leave me too confident.  Since Charlie and I will be going on vacation at varying times over the next two weeks, maybe we shoudl have a meeting to show you guys the kinds of things we looked at?
[07/05 09:35] <triveni> sure debbie..
[07/05 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes!
[07/05 09:36] <02charlie> yeah, and although i've done the paperwork and the t/o note (not as good as yours, debbie, but somewhat descriptive), i still need to update a few items on my end to make that whole process a bit smoother
[07/05 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> that should be helpful!
[07/05 09:37] <dsk_hbe> ok, I'm peeking at all of our calendars.  How does 2:00 sound?
[07/05 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Sounds great to me!
[07/05 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS>  :)
[07/05 09:37] <triveni> same here
[07/05 09:38] <02charlie> yep
[07/05 09:38] <dsk_hbe> cool, I'll send out a meeting notice
[07/05 09:39] <triveni> We will be covering the mail chain issue about jdbutill and zlfdbridge issues?
[07/05 09:40] <triveni> yeah ur invite says so too.. :)
[07/05 09:40] <dsk_hbe> well mostly just how we resolve it on our end... there is nothign pretty about it.  The web apps are able to do it quickly, but I have been thinkig all weekend and can think of no good way to make our piece handle these better.
[07/05 09:41] <triveni> ok debbie..
[07/05 09:41] <dsk_hbe> so we always have a bit of a mess to clean up.
[07/05 10:04] <triveni> debbie..
[07/05 10:04] <triveni> where should i check the logs
[07/05 10:04] <triveni> in sysg
[07/05 10:04] <dsk_hbe> for?
[07/05 10:04] <02charlie> for what?
[07/05 10:04] <triveni> i just wanted to see the errors
[07/05 10:04] <triveni> zlfdbridge errors
[07/05 10:05] <triveni> or the jdbutill errors
[07/05 10:05] <dsk_hbe> well there were two apps that issued errors... jmenu and zlfdbridge
[07/05 10:05] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:05] <dsk_hbe> sec
[07/05 10:05] <dsk_hbe> oh wait... did we set you up with Gail's aliases?
[07/05 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> i ll hv to check them once again
[07/05 10:06] <dsk_hbe> ok... so use zlogprodbridge for the bridge
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> but we did something
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> where should i check
[07/05 10:06] <dsk_hbe> and zlogprodmenu1 and men2 for the jmenus
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> where should i check dem
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> in one of the systems
[07/05 10:06] <dsk_hbe> you said sysg
[07/05 10:06] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:06] <dsk_hbe> but they are on all systems
[07/05 10:07] <dsk_hbe> then yesterday's logs are named like this - sysgip.JMenu_prod_PRDJMN1G.out.2017-07-04
[07/05 10:07] <triveni> yup they are working
[07/05 10:07] <dsk_hbe> awesome
[07/05 10:08] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:08] <triveni> what should i look for
[07/05 10:09] <triveni> are we looking for out of memory errors
[07/05 10:09] <dsk_hbe> I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but fyi, to find any and all errors in any zlfd log, you can do this /errorId
[07/05 10:09] <dsk_hbe> not the 'I' is capitalized.
[07/05 10:10] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:10] <dsk_hbe> we can talk in more detail at the meeting if none of that makes sense
[07/05 10:10] <dsk_hbe> not=note
[07/05 10:10] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:10] <dsk_hbe> you can also pull up all zlfd errors using smapi... there will be a few ;-)
[07/05 10:10] <triveni> ok
[07/05 10:11] <triveni> i can spot some jdbutil errors and all
[07/05 10:11] <triveni> I was just trying to see the errors in logs..
[07/05 10:11] <triveni> that what issue came
[07/05 10:11] <triveni> which we will discuss in the meeting
[07/05 10:13] <dsk_hbe> our biggest goalint he meeting will be to show you how to recover... you will see the errors in the many tickets that come in, unfortunately.  so we'll discuss the recovery first and then we'll talk more about the ugliness that you are looking at.
[07/05 10:13] <triveni> ok debbie..
[07/05 10:29] <dsk_hbe> can any of you get to the ss-mvs sharepoint site?
[07/05 10:29] <dsk_hbe> ah, finally got in... wow, slow

[07/05 10:32] <dsk_hbe> ok :-)
[07/05 10:32] <triveni> i ll let u continue with ur work for now.
[07/05 10:33] <dsk_hbe> thanks!  I have a couple other things bbrewing I need to get done before I go on vacation (again ;-) on Friday ;-)
[07/05 10:33] <triveni> ;)))
[07/05 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> btw, milage update: 1875 miles over the weekend across 5 states!
[07/05 10:34] <triveni> no clue what that means..
[07/05 10:34] <triveni> ;)
[07/05 10:35] <triveni> wait for Jim..to comment on that..probably he ll b v proud of you..
[07/05 10:36] <dsk_hbe> Jim is on vacation, but hopefully he won't miss that ;-)  How was Charleston, Amit?
[07/05 10:38] <06Amit_ZOS> Charleston was beautiful! looked a lot like a french colony!
[07/05 10:38] <dsk_hbe> doing my best to fill in for Jim... getting a spalsh of... tea... coffee, bleh!
[07/05 10:38] <06Amit_ZOS> and coastal areas are always fun to visit!
[07/05 10:39] <02charlie> lol
[07/05 10:39] <triveni> @debbie.. hehheeh lol ;)
[07/05 10:39] <06Amit_ZOS> although did not get time for that ghost tour! 
[07/05 10:39] <02charlie> the full eclipse will go thru charleston
[07/05 10:41] <dsk_hbe> back
[07/05 10:41] <dsk_hbe> ah man, sorry you missed a ghost tour.  It is really interesting... made my neck hairs stand up a little ;-)
[07/05 10:42] <dsk_hbe> but yes, it is a beautiful city, though I hear very expensive to live in
[07/05 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah..
[07/05 10:44] <dsk_hbe> Triveni, did you have a good trip back tot he states?  I hope your family loved all the tech goods you brought for them ;-)
[07/05 10:44] <02charlie> hmm, still puzzled by the fdretc abends monday
[07/05 10:45] <triveni> i loved the trip
[07/05 10:45] <triveni> it was way too much fun
[07/05 10:45] <dsk_hbe> oh shoot, I was going to peek at that after we chatted yesterday, Charlie... I want to see if they were bulk
[07/05 10:45] <triveni> yeah and they enjoyed the goods!!
[07/05 10:45] <triveni> and m so happy to be back in states..
[07/05 10:46] <02charlie> 654 of them all from 015459 to 020055, all user PTRSNJ, all bridge copies, and all DISPLAY_WITH_ASET_REFRESHQLRB returned a fatal error code, detail: 7013
[07/05 10:46] <triveni> definitely the faster net helps
[07/05 10:46] <dsk_hbe> and back to a good internet service :-)
[07/05 10:46] <triveni> yes
[07/05 10:46] <triveni> and some of my fav shows were banned there..
[07/05 10:46] <triveni> i can finally watch them in netflix now
[07/05 10:46] <dsk_hbe> oh no
[07/05 10:46] <triveni> :))
[07/05 10:47] <dsk_hbe> so not bulk... I need to go find where I saw him in my stats... cecking
[07/05 10:47] <triveni> when does fdretc abends happen?
[07/05 10:48] <triveni> is it something major..
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> most often here lately when we timeout a transaction int he abuser processing... i.e. here is one stat from the abuser report I have in e88dsk50:
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> 021023 8112 000  PTRSNJ   031        120  117.895  306.160      30     24
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> 021023 8212 GRP   USER   TRAN     TRAN    SECONDS DELAYED    TIMED  BCKLG
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> 021023 8212 NUM    ID    CODE     COUNT   AVERAGE /  MAX.     OUT   CANCL
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> so we timed out 30, cancelled 24
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> and that's just one copy
[07/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> the rest of the bridge copies show more
[07/05 10:52] <dsk_hbe> my e88dsk60 job shows he only sent down 1,947 browses, though:
[07/05 10:52] <dsk_hbe> PTRSNJ001F    00001947
[07/05 10:52] <triveni> in which run are u watching
[07/05 10:52] <dsk_hbe> and none of his browses show up as pigs in my e88dsk10 job
[07/05 10:52] <triveni> monday's run
[07/05 10:52] <dsk_hbe> the Jul4th run (which is for july3rd data)
[07/05 10:52] <triveni> yeah got it
[07/05 10:53] <dsk_hbe> that sure is puzzling, Charlie
[07/05 10:53] <02charlie> hmm
[07/05 10:55] <02charlie> yeah, i dont know what caused all that, still puzzled
[07/05 10:56] <dsk_hbe> I hope we haven't finally hit a spot where mainframe CRE can't handle something that LCRE can :-/
[07/05 10:56] <triveni> can we check which database they were trying to search
[07/05 10:56] <triveni> is there any relation..if the search pattern is common..
[07/05 10:56] <02charlie> no db in the abends
[07/05 10:57] <02charlie> hmm, usually CRE handles things better than LCRE
[07/05 10:57] <dsk_hbe> yeah, that's been my experience as well... sad isn't it?
[07/05 11:02] <dsk_hbe> maybe it is due to their input arrival time... I filtered in smapi on retype '14' (error) and the 145 that got that were all submitted from 01:54:18 to 01:54:23.
[07/05 11:03] <dsk_hbe> sounds like they were somewhat automated because they are not all looking at the same aset
[07/05 11:04] <dsk_hbe> so something non-human seems like
[07/05 11:04] <02charlie> yeah, that's what im thinking
[07/05 11:04] <02charlie> way to many for a human to do
[07/05 11:04] <02charlie> too
[07/05 11:04] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah... Triveni hit it... ">(CUSTOMS ACT 1901 PRE/15 LEG-REF(50))</
[07/05 11:04] <dsk_hbe> same search over and over and over again... 
[07/05 11:05] <dsk_hbe> my browser said there were more than 100

[07/05 11:05] <triveni> cool
[07/05 11:05] <dsk_hbe> so once again we thank Wayne's abuser logic for not allowing this to make our lives miserable
[07/05 11:06] <02charlie> yes
[07/05 11:08] <triveni> but charlie..where did u notice dese abends
[07/05 11:08] <triveni> in diary
[07/05 11:08] <dsk_hbe> and to be clear for Amit and Triveni... while those actually ran in the 01:00 hour of July 4th, keep in mind that theyw ere actually for our Lexis day of July 3rd, since a Lexis day goes from 02:00 to 02:00, with a little extra past that included from the bridge copies
[07/05 11:08] <triveni> i was trying to find that
[07/05 11:08] <dsk_hbe> so you will find the abends he is talking abotu int he July 3rd data as well
[07/05 11:08] <triveni> ok debbie..
[07/05 11:08] <triveni> ok
[07/05 11:09] <06Amit_ZOS> hmm
[07/05 11:09] <dsk_hbe> it all made more sense when we all though 02:00-02:00... then those darned web applciations came along ;-)
[07/05 11:09] <dsk_hbe> *thought
[07/05 11:15] <dsk_hbe> hey guys, Charlie has messed with that DDF issue mroe recently than I so I leave you in his hands for guidance ont hat new ticket
[07/05 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Charlie, i didn't realize that Im not on Daytime..
[07/05 11:18] <02charlie> well, put yourself in :)
[07/05 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i can own the ticket if you'd like..
[07/05 11:18] <02charlie> and we can walk thru the ticket
[07/05 11:18] <02charlie> that's fine
[07/05 11:18] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, we took you out fro the weekend.
[07/05 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> did
[07/05 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> already
[07/05 11:19] <06Amit_ZOS> so where do we get this DDF information?
[07/05 11:21] <06Amit_ZOS> the notes say here /data2/datafeeds/DDF/20170704. but it doesnt make too much sense to me
[07/05 11:21] <06Amit_ZOS> where is this?
[07/05 11:21] <02charlie> well, it's done in job E1PSDDFX which can be found in SE00EOD$CLASSIC  OLS Classic End Of Day   14/08/10  A A E00E00
[07/05 11:22] <06Amit_ZOS> oh.. can i check that in savrs?
[07/05 11:22] <02charlie> which is no longer in the current plan
[07/05 11:22] <02charlie> yes
[07/05 11:22] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[07/05 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> so thtat ftp didn't go through well.. is that it?
[07/05 11:24] <02charlie> lm check savrs
[07/05 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> PE00.PBR.DDF.D0704.T0000.MERGE-- is this the file we'r supposed to resend?
[07/05 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> oops
[07/05 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> how did tht bold itself?
[07/05 11:25] <02charlie> :)
[07/05 11:25] <02charlie> EZA1701I >>> STOR DDF_20170704

[07/05 11:25] <02charlie> so the ftp worked, but they need the file resent
[07/05 11:26] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[07/05 11:26] <06Amit_ZOS> there must have been some goof up after the file was recieved then
[07/05 11:26] <06Amit_ZOS> so do we just re-run the job?
[07/05 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> will be heading to the 1:1 in a few
[07/05 11:27] <02charlie> basically, but i think we need to tweak it a bit
[07/05 11:28] <02charlie> go, and i'll figure out what we need to do
[07/05 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, you mean we need to take out some opc stuff and enter it manually?
[07/05 11:28] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. thanks
[07/05 11:28] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away

[07/05 11:43] <06Amit_zOS> im back
[07/05 11:44] <02charlie> ok
[07/05 11:46] <06Amit_zOS> what can i do charlie?
[07/05 11:48] <02charlie> you can find the jcl here: PT00.OPCA.OLMR.JCLLIB
[07/05 11:48] <02charlie> if you view that JCL, you will notice:
[07/05 11:48] <02charlie> these FTP commands:
[07/05 11:48] <02charlie> BINARY

[07/05 11:49] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[07/05 11:49] <06Amit_zOS> saw em
[07/05 11:49] <02charlie> (it's easier if you have the JCL, although you can see all of this in the SAVRS outut too)
[07/05 11:49] <02charlie> it's just savrs has more noise
[07/05 11:49] <06Amit_zOS> true
[07/05 11:49] <triveni> which jcl in that jcllib
[07/05 11:50] <06Amit_zOS> PT00.OPCA.OLMR.JCLLIB(E1PSDDFX)
[07/05 11:50] <02charlie> if you look at the SAVRS, the mkdir, cd, and put all worked
[07/05 11:50] <triveni> yeah
[07/05 11:50] <triveni> i can see it now
[07/05 11:50] <02charlie> since they want the file put out there again, we need to rerun, but we dont want to do the mkdir, because that will fail
[07/05 11:51] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[07/05 11:51] <triveni> yeah coz the dir is already dere now
[07/05 11:51] <02charlie> and to rerun we have two choices: submit the job manually, with *ALL* the appropriate edits, or
[07/05 11:51] <triveni> just cd will do
[07/05 11:52] <02charlie> add the application to OPC, NONR all the other steps, and edit the (now) in-plan JCL
[07/05 11:53] <06Amit_zOS> id like the first 1 since this is just a one time thing .. but your call
[07/05 11:53] <02charlie> yes, that's what i would recommend
[07/05 11:53] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[07/05 11:53] <triveni> i ll watch u guys run it
[07/05 11:53] <02charlie> I suggest copying PT00.OPCA.OLMR.JCLLIB(E1PSDDFX) to your own library
[07/05 11:53] <06Amit_zOS> okay
[07/05 11:54] <02charlie> Strip out the OPC command stuff
[07/05 11:56] <triveni> am also following it.. won't submit it though..
[07/05 11:56] <06Amit_zOS> you can check this charlie

[07/05 11:57] <06Amit_zOS> except i dont know what to put in D&TMMDD

[07/05 12:08] <triveni> can we log in to that box
[07/05 12:08] <triveni> and try to see the file we sent
[07/05 12:08] <triveni> there
[07/05 12:08] <triveni> to crosscheck it
[07/05 12:08] <02charlie> and i thought you would take ownership of that ticket too
[07/05 12:08] <triveni> that whether the contents are correct
[07/05 12:08] <02charlie> taking those Q in reverse order:
[07/05 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> done
[07/05 12:09] <06Amit_zOS> have pinged her...
[07/05 12:09] <02charlie> (1) I have no way of knowing whether the contects are correct, because I don't know what the contents should be
[07/05 12:11] <02charlie> (2) I cant log into that box. What I can do (and what I did in preparation for telling amit what to do) was to make a copy of the JCL (which does an FTP to that box), and ran the first few commands to see if the ls showed the existence of the required directory
[07/05 12:11] <02charlie> see, eg,
[07/05 12:11] <02charlie> ULESTCXX J098705 
[07/05 12:11] <triveni> ok 
[07/05 12:12] <triveni> yeah and the file has some goop characters as well.. so there is no way we can be sure about it..
[07/05 12:13] <triveni> checking ur job charlie
[07/05 12:13] <02charlie> i could have gone a step further and added a cd 20170704 and an ls to see if the file was there, but I thought that a waste of time, since the ticket requested we re-send the file
[07/05 12:13] <triveni> yeah
[07/05 12:14] <triveni> thanks charlie!!
[07/05 12:14] <02charlie> sure
[07/05 12:16] <06Amit_zOS> should i close the ticket before Sheri replies to my ping?
[07/05 12:16] <02charlie> i would probably wait
[07/05 12:16] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[07/05 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> She can see the file
[07/05 12:53] <02charlie> ok, then resolve the ticket
[07/05 12:54] <06Amit_zOS> any resolve category you prefer charlie?
[07/05 12:54] <06Amit_zOS> server?
[07/05 12:55] <06Amit_zOS> or just data/metadata?
[07/05 12:55] <dsk_hbe> too bad user error is no longer listed ;-)
[07/05 12:56] <02charlie> last one i did was, data.metadata, data missing, cleanu completed
[07/05 12:57] <02charlie> which environment is cdc12?
[07/05 12:58] <02charlie> oh, it looks like spce
[07/05 12:58] <dsk_hbe> well that shoudl be easy to track down then ;-)
[07/05 12:58] <02charlie> does that show up in cert smapi?

[07/05 15:19] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[07/05 15:19] <dsk_hbe> I wish I coudl tell you why some call it ppce and others call it ppc0
[07/05 15:24] <dsk_hbe> guys, looking back at some of the events from last year, it was 37 and 38 jdbutil transactions that took longer than 100 seconds... so still suspect that issue if we are less than 40, but close.

[07/05 15:44] <02charlie> hmm, well, jim c is messing with access lists now
[07/05 15:45] <02charlie> which one are you trying, the url i gave you or the one debbie gave you?
[07/05 15:45] <06Amit_zOS> no, she is having issues with launching chopin..
[07/05 15:45] <06Amit_zOS> not the access issue
[07/05 15:45] <dsk_hbe> is she not launching from an URL?
[07/05 15:46] <06Amit_zOS> was looking into her java setttings and it was pretty much the same.. 
[07/05 15:46] <06Amit_zOS> yes, was not launching even after she clicked the link
[07/05 15:46] <dsk_hbe> I see
[07/05 15:48] <06Amit_zOS> i have both downloaded so i could use either
[07/05 15:55] <dsk_hbe> I need to head out.  The parm file is set to go for E00LLSD0 tonight, Charlie.  I don't expect it to cause you any grief, but please yell at me if it does.

[07/06 09:33] <triveni> its raining heavily here..
[07/06 09:33] <triveni> so far connected from home..
[07/06 09:33] <dsk_hbe> do you guys normally walk to work?  so you are in apartments across the street?
[07/06 09:35] <06Amit_ZOS> in conditions like these, we can use the car but will get drenched anyway by the time you get from parking to b1 enterance 
[07/06 09:36] <triveni> i normally walk to work..
[07/06 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Triveni atleast has an umbrella, i just use a jacket..
[07/06 09:36] <triveni> yeah i have an umbrella
[07/06 09:36] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I'd rather drive in snow that poring rain where you can't see anything, even across the street!
[07/06 09:36] <triveni> but i think that won't be sufficient today
[07/06 09:37] <dsk_hbe> I hope they have across walk there now.  That street is busy!
[07/06 09:37] <triveni> it ll slow down in a while.. i hope..
[07/06 09:37] <triveni> how z the weather there debbie..
[07/06 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> it is busy usually in the mornings.. hard to cross.. the crosswalk is at the signal in front of b4
[07/06 09:38] <dsk_hbe> personally I'd just stay put... but that's just me, one of the original home-based employees, speaking ;-)
[07/06 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> and i live in front of b1
[07/06 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[07/06 09:38] <dsk_hbe> oh my... you be careful doing that!!!
[07/06 09:38] <triveni> i wish mirc would have supported images and videos..
[07/06 09:38] <triveni> i could have just showed u
[07/06 09:38] <triveni> how hard its raining ;)
[07/06 09:38] <dsk_hbe> text me :-)
[07/06 09:39] <triveni> ;)
[07/06 09:39] <dsk_hbe> well, deleting the first pass of eclipse users from the file reduced the number of CS prints we created from 240 yesterday to 132 today... I want more, more, MORE!
[07/06 09:52] <02charlie> delete them all, and let God sort them out :)
[07/06 09:53] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/06 09:53] <02charlie> ok, i need to reboot for these updates, be back in a minute

[07/06 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> its starting to request mine to do the updates..
[07/06 10:05] <02charlie> :(
[07/06 10:06] <02charlie> i just hate making changes when im oncall
[07/06 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, what does the latency actually mean in the smappi c++ browser report?
[07/06 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> say a latency of 0:00:55.318 for a qbrowse transaction
[07/06 10:08] <dsk_hbe> sorry... was looking elsewhere... let me pull that up, sec
[07/06 10:09] <dsk_hbe> can't say I ever paid attention to that field.
[07/06 10:09] <dsk_hbe> still waiting on smapi to answer me
[07/06 10:13] <dsk_hbe> no idea :-)
[07/06 10:13] <dsk_hbe> try asking JimC maybe
[07/06 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. which means, it hasn't been a concern for us for 28 years.. im not gonna pursue this tangent
[07/06 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[07/06 10:14] <dsk_hbe> you are so very smart ;-) ;-)
[07/06 10:16] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, i spent a lot of money for my graduate studies.. I'd better be smart!
[07/06 10:16] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[07/06 10:16] <02charlie> well, and remember rule 1 :)

[07/06 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah i was looking at those abends that happened yesterday
[07/06 10:21] <dsk_hbe> AMit, I found my way to an actual doc on SMAPI itself... doesn't mention latency at all, LOL

[07/06 11:58] <triveni> i dont see any page for this ticket as well
[07/06 12:01] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey debbie, the other day you had shared a link to the sys sup sharepoint, where i can use the common login id's and pwd's to get all access to libs
[07/06 12:01] <02charlie> that is a ticket i created
[07/06 12:01] <triveni> yeah
[07/06 12:01] <triveni> but its in our bucket
[07/06 12:02] <triveni> assignment group is zos sys support
[07/06 12:02] <06Amit_ZOS> i cant seem to login with that login info
[07/06 12:02] <06Amit_ZOS> into cert ldc
[07/06 12:04] <02charlie> this particular editing group has a tendency to do this with these tickets. they dont have a clue, and dont have a clue how to have a clue
[07/06 12:04] <06Amit_ZOS> haha
[07/06 12:04] <triveni> lol
[07/06 12:08] <dsk_hbe> sorry, Amit, someone was at my door... here's that URL - https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/sys-sup/default.aspx
[07/06 12:09] <dsk_hbe> the Product How-Tos section will have the next link yu need... under passwords,product login information
[07/06 12:10] <dsk_hbe> and I don't know if these IDs will have more access than yours already does.  I think that inews source you were looking for might only be availbale in classic
[07/06 12:10] <dsk_hbe> worth a try though
[07/06 12:11] <06Amit_ZOS> yes i tried those.. i think they might for prod ldc but not for cert.. i tried for cert and it didn't put me through
[07/06 12:12] <02charlie> this page? https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/sys-sup/How%20Tos%20Limited%20Access/Product%20Logon%20Information.aspx
[07/06 12:13] <06Amit_ZOS> yes charlie
[07/06 12:13] <02charlie> the cert urls are in the second column
[07/06 12:13] <06Amit_ZOS> and i actually was looking for the NEXIS library..
[07/06 12:14] <02charlie> https://ppc0.nexis.com
[07/06 12:14] <dsk_hbe> if it doesn't work, which happens sometimes, we can let JimC's team know and they can fix it.
[07/06 12:14] <dsk_hbe> sometimes the URLs in ppc0 land get messed up
[07/06 12:15] <02charlie> i got in fine
[07/06 12:15] <06Amit_ZOS> for the cert url i was using :https://cdc5-www.lexisnexis.com/start/signin?service=lexis&contractURL=https%3a%2f%2fcdc5-w3.lexis.com%2fresearch2%2fauthResource.do%3f_m%3d48643178e6e06a40b863441e942b218a&key=_cC4F6E4C0-C16A-2CB1-166D-DAF661A26CDC_kF0ED35AC-3261-A097-423E-FDBAE66A20C4&event=form
[07/06 12:15] <02charlie> no
[07/06 12:15] <02charlie> if you want nexis
[07/06 12:15] <dsk_hbe> that's a different animal
[07/06 12:15] <02charlie> use the one i pasted
[07/06 12:15] <06Amit_ZOS> but i guess if i need NEXIS, i will need to use the nexis url
[07/06 12:16] <02charlie> that's fabc lexis.com
[07/06 12:16] <06Amit_ZOS> makes sense to me now
[07/06 12:16] <dsk_hbe> I ma sure ther eis nexis in the cdc's too, but can't promise you what IDs work there
[07/06 12:17] <dsk_hbe> fabc lexis.com is actually different URL... we have to set it up to go through release.lexis.com... I'm not sure why they never set up it's own ppc0 URL
[07/06 12:17] <dsk_hbe> the ppc0 nexis one is Rosetta
[07/06 12:17] <dsk_hbe> oh sorry... I see now that Charlie was referrign to the messy URL you pasted Amit... ignore me
[07/06 12:18] <02charlie> :)
[07/06 12:20] <06Amit_ZOS> nexis is a different animal too.. i can't find a dot command facility here charlie?
[07/06 12:20] <06Amit_ZOS> Anita didn't get to that part and i forgot to ask!
[07/06 12:21] <02charlie> what are you trying to search?
[07/06 12:21] <02charlie> i dont think you need to do dot command with that product
[07/06 12:21] <06Amit_ZOS> just trying to test that doc you just raised a ticket for
[07/06 12:22] <02charlie> which doc?
[07/06 12:22] <06Amit_ZOS> test=retrieve (DB/LNI 0435/3S8H-26Y0-000H-H4HD )
[07/06 12:22] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/06 12:23] <02charlie> that doc is temp-deleted so any search will not retrieve it
[07/06 12:23] <06Amit_zOS> oh.. ok.. but anyhow.. how would i go about trying to retrieve it
[07/06 12:24] <02charlie> it was initially temp-deleted back in November, then someone put it online again, and i had them smack it again
[07/06 12:24] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[07/06 12:24] <02charlie> if you want to look at it you can serprt it
[07/06 12:25] <02charlie> i serprted it yesterday, i think, because they had resolved the ticket
[07/06 12:25] <06Amit_zOS> people generally freestyle their search in nexis.com right, so i was wondering how you see if you are able to view the file well from the url..
[07/06 12:26] <02charlie> so i checked, and it was still temp deleted and so i rejected their resolution
[07/06 12:26] <06Amit_zOS> okay
[07/06 12:26] <02charlie> generally, because i have a suspicious mind, whenever they resolve a ticket, i check to make sure they did it right
[07/06 12:26] <02charlie> and they didnt
[07/06 12:27] <06Amit_zOS> but you serprted from the mvs side right, i guess what im asking is that if there is anyway to check out the doc through the nexis cert url
[07/06 12:27] <02charlie> nope, not when it's temp-deleted. the system will not retrieve temp-deleted docs
[07/06 12:28] <02charlie> also wont delete docs marked for perm-delete
[07/06 12:28] <02charlie> also wont *retrieve* docs marked for perm-delete
[07/06 12:28] <06Amit_zOS> what if it wasnt temp deletd?
[07/06 12:28] <02charlie> then you could try and get it in a search
[07/06 12:29] <06Amit_zOS> so you mean, you will need to know the contents of the doc in order to search it right? and then possibly hope your answer set has that doc!
[07/06 12:29] <06Amit_zOS> correct?
[07/06 12:29] <02charlie> no, i just need the lni
[07/06 12:30] <02charlie> search terms: lni(<insert lni here>)
[07/06 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> yes thats what i wanted to know.. how do you use the lni to search a doc in nexis
[07/06 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> ah.. thats it? 
[07/06 12:30] <02charlie> yep
[07/06 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> wonderful!
[07/06 12:31] <06Amit_zOS> v easy
[07/06 12:31] <02charlie> so in this case i'd put lni(3S8H-26Y0-000H-H4HD) in the search terms box
[07/06 12:32] <06Amit_zOS> gotcha
[07/06 12:32] <02charlie> similar in lexis.com, except i'd do this in a dot command search box: 
[07/06 12:32] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you yet again charlie!
[07/06 12:33] <02charlie> NIKKEI;NIKKEI;lni(3S8H-26Y0-000H-H4HD)
[07/06 12:33] <06Amit_zOS> oh, so you could search the same doc through lexis.com!???????????????????????????
[07/06 12:33] <02charlie> yep
[07/06 12:33] <02charlie> unless it tells me i dont have access to those files
[07/06 12:33] <06Amit_zOS> don't i look like a fool now
[07/06 12:34] <06Amit_zOS> ugh!
[07/06 12:34] <02charlie> no, you look like an intelligent person who knows to ask questions
[07/06 12:35] <06Amit_zOS> You'r too kind charlie! :)
[07/06 12:35] <02charlie> i'm still perfectly willing to (and do) make myself appear stupid by asking Jim and Debbie questions they probably think i should already know the answer to
[07/06 12:36] <02charlie> but i'd rather appear stupid than actually do something stupid because i was afraid to ask
[07/06 12:36] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[07/06 12:38] <triveni> i want to get the group cert url
[07/06 12:39] <dsk_hbe> stupid is never a word that would occur to me to describe you Charlie!
[07/06 12:39] <triveni> which amit started
[07/06 12:39] <triveni> the first question
[07/06 12:40] <02charlie> the url i pasted above
[07/06 12:40] <02charlie> (the 1st one gives all the logins)
[07/06 12:40] <02charlie> (2nd one is the cert nexis url)
[07/06 12:40] <triveni> but for the group ids
[07/06 12:40] <triveni> will that work
[07/06 12:41] <02charlie> yep
[07/06 12:41] <triveni> for this lni i can click the first one
[07/06 12:41] <triveni> right?
[07/06 12:42] <02charlie> that lni wont come up in any search
[07/06 12:42] <triveni> https://www.lexis.com

[07/06 13:35] <06Amit_zOS> done
[07/06 14:25] <dsk_hbe> ugh... getting more update downloads
[07/06 14:26] <02charlie> :(
[07/06 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> same!
[07/06 14:26] <02charlie> not yet here
[07/06 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> why don't they do everything at once!?
[07/06 14:41] <dsk_hbe> boy, good thing you and Bobbie got that stylesheet thing dealt with, Charlie!  I bet that woudl have been a huge mess if it hit prod.
[07/06 14:42] <02charlie> ugh, yeah
[07/06 14:42] <02charlie> that's why i was so concerned about it yesterday. still trying to deal with it today
[07/06 14:43] <dsk_hbe> definitely good reason to be concerned... and boy, what did the folks making the changes check :-(
[07/06 14:44] <dsk_hbe> I mean stylesheet=browse... so check browses folks!
[07/06 14:45] <02charlie> i think the cite list which shows the hits uses the stylesheets too
[07/06 14:45] <02charlie> she was seeing goofy stuff just there
[07/06 14:45] <dsk_hbe> I woudl imagine
[07/06 14:46] <02charlie> this is one of the top documents in her search: Now that nuclear proliferation has once again crept into our lives, it brings to mind the 1950s, when we were taught in elementary school in case of a nuclear attack, to duck under our desks and cover our heads. This, we were assured by Bert the Turtle, would certainly protect us from Armageddon and, in case of a nuclear blast, we would 
[07/06 14:46] <02charlie> live to tell about it.
[07/06 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. nice!
[07/06 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> its well written!
[07/06 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> i like it!
[07/06 14:47] <02charlie> this is the third paragraph: Obviously, we now know that the only real protection against radiation (and Kryptonite, too, I think) is lead. So Ive decided to use a crowdfunding source like Kickstarter to create a lead countertop business. When the bombs start to fall, just empty your cupboards and climb in. Youll be safe and sound when all your neighbors are fried to a crisp!
[07/06 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> ooooooh
[07/06 15:01] <02charlie> debbie, this guy is one of our frequent flyers, isnt he? GQV9H0 
[07/06 15:02] <dsk_hbe> yeah, he has been lately
[07/06 15:02] <02charlie> he caused 12 abends in SRPSEL in the FDs on the 1st

[07/06 15:06] <dsk_hbe> looks like a relentless user trying the same thing repeatedly.
[07/06 15:07] <dsk_hbe> I bet if you pull up his searches in C++ they will either be the same or very similar
[07/06 15:09] <02charlie> hmm, BESSMER TRUST NEW YORK, NEW YORK 
[07/06 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> same sesssion id..
[07/06 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> so your right
[07/06 15:10] <dsk_hbe> he could still be entering different searches in the same session, but I bet he's still relentless
[07/06 15:14] <06Amit_zOS> ugh!
[07/06 15:14] <06Amit_zOS> i cant see the search string.. i thought one of the dimestores had that feature right?
[07/06 15:15] <dsk_hbe> right... the secure one... sec
[07/06 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> doesnt it show when i ask it to give the error records
[07/06 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> http://lngcentral.lexisnexis.com/webs/rap/secure/reports/CBrowserS.asp
[07/06 15:15] <dsk_hbe> http://lngcentral.lexisnexis.com/webs/rap/secure/reports/SmapiBrowserS.asp
[07/06 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[07/06 15:15] <dsk_hbe> looks like enough of a match ;-)
[07/06 15:16] <dsk_hbe> and it's all the same dimestore... just one URL gives us different access
[07/06 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> i see.. but i still dont see the search string
[07/06 15:17] <dsk_hbe> lemme look
[07/06 15:17] <06Amit_zOS> oh do i need to give that error type 14 thingy?
[07/06 15:17] <06Amit_zOS> rec type srry
[07/06 15:18] <dsk_hbe> you can, but you shodl see the search string in both successful and unsuccessful sKERs
[07/06 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> yup now i can see
[07/06 15:19] <dsk_hbe> you don't list the associated tuids, but fwiw, I see seraches for all of this guys' 11:00 hour data
[07/06 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> i was just asking it to give error records, you need to ask it to give KERS in order to see them
[07/06 15:19] <dsk_hbe> ok, yes, has to be KERs
[07/06 15:21] <dsk_hbe> they sure got carried away with teh parenthesis
[07/06 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> im just finding 3 error records there
[07/06 15:24] <06Amit_zOS> you mean this part is it? ((company((HLEAD((know your customer) or ALLCAPS(kyc))))) and ((sec or finra)))</field></string></boolean></search>
[07/06 15:25] <dsk_hbe> the search string is what is within the 'string' '/string' bookends
[07/06 15:25] <dsk_hbe> I don't know if the parens are the problem... it was just a comment... some looked to be redundant
[07/06 15:26] <06Amit_zOS> ah, anyway.. hopefully the guy gave up and must have gone home
[07/06 15:27] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[07/06 15:27] <06Amit_zOS> some of them look like negative news searches

[07/07 08:30] <02charlie> good morning amit
[07/07 08:30] <06Amit_ZOS> GM charlie!
[07/07 08:31] <triveni> HCSINBND EXEC BPXPROC,FILENAME=E1PTJ27S.027.T07300168
[07/07 08:31] <triveni> this step returned soc2
[07/07 08:33] <triveni> and it fails in SYSIN step
[07/07 08:36] <02charlie> and notice the sysin step is just an iebgener
[07/07 08:36] <triveni> yes
[07/07 08:37] <triveni> so its the file access problem
[07/07 08:37] <triveni> thus soc2
[07/07 08:37] <triveni> or could be the path
[07/07 08:38] <triveni> but charlie later at 8.30 v had good runs
[07/07 08:38] <02charlie> good, maybe they fixed the issue
[07/07 08:38] <triveni> are u sure these opc error list appplications are the same as the ticket jobs
[07/07 08:39] <02charlie> no, theyre not the same, but they're showing the same symptoms as in the ticket
[07/07 08:39] <triveni> ohh ok
[07/07 08:39] <02charlie> [07/07 08:16] <charlie> Multi i4g*d - i4b*z - i4j* failing soc2 and soc4 - all failing on sysG
[07/07 08:40] <triveni> i couldn't find bad runs for i4g*d in savrs
[07/07 08:40] <triveni> i was checking in tsoc
[07/07 08:40] <triveni> but at least i can clear the opc now
[07/07 08:40] <triveni> or should we wait
[07/07 08:42] <02charlie> no, clear those
[07/07 08:42] <02charlie> and most ofthe i4g*d are on SYSW
[07/07 08:42] <triveni> ok 
[07/07 08:43] <06Amit_ZOS> you mean complete right?
[07/07 08:43] <06Amit_ZOS> complete those?
[07/07 08:43] <02charlie> yes, complete
[07/07 08:44] <triveni> yeah
[07/07 08:44] <triveni> this is ours too SEUCSMRWCHFPDLY
[07/07 08:45] <triveni> EUCSWF1D
[07/07 08:45] <triveni> it doesn't have a clean run yet
[07/07 08:45] <02charlie> i didnt think we had SEUC*
[07/07 08:46] <triveni> ok
[07/07 08:46] <triveni> but that also failed at iebgener step
[07/07 08:47] <06Amit_ZOS> thats a CERT SmartWatchFeedPrcss
[07/07 08:47] <02charlie> yeah, that app is not ours
[07/07 08:47] <06Amit_ZOS> not ours
[07/07 08:48] <06Amit_ZOS> btw charlie, did yesterdays issue get confirmed to be an abuser?
[07/07 08:49] <02charlie> havent gotten to that today, we had some jdbutil spikes around that time too, but i dont think any > 5 sec, so that may have caused some delay
[07/07 08:49] <06Amit_ZOS> okay
[07/07 08:53] <triveni> charlie, in i4g* job it gave soc4
[07/07 08:53] <triveni> its a sort step
[07/07 08:53] <triveni> and in sortIn step , file was PI00.PROD.DER.DOSSIER.JANDZ.DB.LIST
[07/07 08:54] <triveni> soc4 protection exception
[07/07 08:55] <02charlie> yeah, i'm not spending time on that one, since we cant do anything about it and its not our jcl
[07/07 08:56] <triveni> great
[07/07 08:57] <triveni> what to do with the ticket then
[07/07 08:57] <02charlie> it hasnt been out ticket since 0805

[07/07 10:14] <02charlie> well, the lzay people who tuched it before her sent if back to us because they couldnt figure out what was wrong with the doc

[07/11 09:33] <JimE_zOS> which I think is going to get pushed out.

[07/11 09:33] <JimE_zOS> so not an ongoing issue 
[07/11 09:34] <JimE_zOS> right now just listening to people defer to each other (because none of them know what to do). 
[07/11 09:34] <JimE_zOS> sadly amusing. 
[07/11 09:35] <06Amit_ZOS> Congrats Sir Jim on the nomination for the P2P!!!!!! :D

[07/11 14:29] <02charlie> crexpg can be a bad doc, but in the LSR it's usually a time punch
[07/11 14:30] <02charlie> crexdd is usually always a bad doc
[07/11 14:30] <06Amit_ZOS> ok

[07/12 11:02] <triveni> paged
[07/12 11:03] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[07/12 11:03] <JimE_zOS> looking
[07/12 11:03] <triveni> hi
[07/12 11:03] <triveni> Jim
[07/12 11:04] <triveni> one more page
[07/12 11:06] <triveni> I think debbie guided us about it
[07/12 11:07] <triveni> syscmvs : syscip.ZlfdBridge_prod_PRDZBRC ZlfdBridge_ZBRIDGE_JSERV_ERR : sysc 844
[07/12 11:07] <triveni> and the other page was for multiple ZlfdBridge.APP_ERROR_LIMIT & ZBRIDGE_MONITOR_END
[07/12 11:09] <charlie_away> jim, do you want me to call into the conference bridge?
[07/12 11:09] <triveni> charlie, is it where i have to bounce the bridge
[07/12 11:10] <triveni> I can try it..
[07/12 11:10] <triveni> if its something else..please guide me..
[07/12 11:12] <JimE_zOS> no, Charlie, thanks
[07/12 11:12] <JimE_zOS> and I'm not calling in right now either. 
[07/12 11:12] <charlie_away> k
[07/12 11:13] <JimE_zOS> you are on vacation. 
[07/12 11:14] <JimE_zOS> mostly of what I see in the bridge log suggests the problem isn't with the bridge but with search 
[07/12 11:14] <triveni> Jim.. whenever u get time.. but please involve me.. I want to work on it.. right now I am analysing it..
[07/12 11:14] <JimE_zOS> working on a rolling bounce of those now. 
[07/12 11:17] <triveni> one more page
[07/12 11:21] <06Amit_ZOS> Out of memory errors?
[07/12 11:29] <triveni> Ican see the status change in chopin
[07/12 11:29] <triveni> Jim already started with the bounces
[07/12 11:30] <JimE_zOS> JSearch copies have all been bounced 
[07/12 11:30] <JimE_zOS> as have the zLFD bridge copies. 
[07/12 11:30] <JimE_zOS> nothing else. 
[07/12 11:30] <triveni> I wanted to do it
[07/12 11:30] <triveni> its ok
[07/12 11:30] <triveni> I will wait for another fiasco
[07/12 11:31] <triveni> Next time maybe
[07/12 11:31] <JimE_zOS> and the bridge log on SYSA looks much cleaner . 
[07/12 11:31] <triveni> Thanks Jim!!
[07/12 11:31] <JimE_zOS> when then start a CAT call and you only have one working zLFD bridge copy before total center outage, it isn't a teaching moment. 
[07/12 11:32] <triveni> yeah i understood
[07/12 11:32] <JimE_zOS> which isn't to say that we can't do follow-up discussion
[07/12 11:32] <triveni> debbie guided us last time how to do it
[07/12 11:32] <triveni> so i was interested
[07/12 11:32] <triveni> yes please tell us what all u did..when u get a chance..

[07/12 11:36] <06Amit_ZOS> is the 6:07 am and this one related Jim?
[07/12 11:39] <JimE_zOS> I don't know that it is related to this, Amit. 
[07/12 11:39] <JimE_zOS> in fact, this long after the copy crashes, I wouldn't think so 
[07/12 11:39] <JimE_zOS> but something isn't right. 
[07/12 11:39] <JimE_zOS> we haven't had a round of LFD copy abends in a very long time. 
[07/12 11:40] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/12 11:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes, Wayne already has the root cuase of that issue and has already tested it in spce
[07/12 11:43] <JimE_zOS> Wayne is Zeus! 
[07/12 11:43] <triveni> yeah!! 
[07/12 11:44] <triveni> what is lexispsl..
[07/12 11:48] <JimE_zOS> I've never used PSL, Triveni, so I can't give you a good product description
[07/12 11:48] <JimE_zOS> PSL is a normal "offender", tho. 
[07/12 11:48] <triveni> ok so one of the product..
[07/12 11:49] <06Amit_ZOS> im assuming its the normal tardyness of chopin that it still shows sysj FDbridge in transitional state
[07/12 11:50] <JimE_zOS> maybe, maybe not. 
[07/12 11:50] <JimE_zOS> chopin isn't really to be trusted. 
[07/12 11:50] <triveni> its blue
[07/12 11:51] <triveni> only sysJ though
[07/12 11:52] <JimE_zOS> yeah....after I recovered the bridge copies on A, C and G, I decided that a SYSJ health bounce was a good idea. 
[07/12 11:53] <JimE_zOS> so I asked chopin to bounce the SYSJ bridge for me. 
[07/12 11:53] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/12 11:53] <JimE_zOS> and, well, it is still trying
[07/12 11:53] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[07/12 11:55] <JimE_zOS> nuked the SYSJ bridge myself and then told chasm/chopin it was down. 
[07/12 11:56] <JimE_zOS> we'll see if that works 
[07/12 11:56] <06Amit_ZOS> Anything that we can do to help Jim!?
[07/12 11:57] <JimE_zOS> I don't think so, Amit.  Assuming chasm will start the SYSJ bridge, I think we are done. 
[07/12 11:57] <06Amit_ZOS> hmm.. 
[07/12 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> sysj looks good in chopin now
[07/12 12:04] <JimE_zOS> yes, it does
[07/12 12:08] <06Amit_ZOS> psc2826 is still red though
[07/12 12:08] <06Amit_ZOS> jinx
[07/12 12:08] <06Amit_ZOS> not anymore
[07/12 12:12] <JimE_zOS> k...I have a 1pm meeting (actually two 1pm meetings) 
[07/12 12:12] <JimE_zOS> so I best get myself to campus. 
[07/12 12:12] <JimE_zOS> Are you folks OK while I'm in transit? 
[07/12 12:15] <JimE_zOS> Triveni?  
[07/12 12:16] <JimE_zOS> I guess I'll take that as a "yep...fine".

[07/13 11:52] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim!
[07/13 11:53] <triveni> morning Jim!!
[07/13 11:53] <JimE_zOS> back from 11:30 concall RE: oracle overload due to development/testing of Lexis RED 
[07/13 11:54] <06Amit_ZOS> will we be doing the zap installation today?
[07/13 11:57] <JimE_zOS> zap isn't ready yet, Amit. 
[07/13 11:57] <JimE_zOS> created and code reviewed. 
[07/13 11:57] <JimE_zOS> but it still has to go through VLG, PLG and SPCE testing. 
[07/13 11:57] <JimE_zOS> once Wayne is done with those tasks, he'll make the zap as "certified" in the tool.
[07/13 11:58] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> at that point, the zap is ready 
[07/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> some we apply, some we hold just in case we need them. 
[07/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> this one, I'll apply 
[07/13 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> but he said: "In my opinion, the review and this exercise of the zap are sufficient to certify it for production use."
[07/13 11:58] <JimE_zOS> or, we'll apply :-)
[07/13 11:59] <JimE_zOS> yeah....but until the zap is marked "certified", I can't proceed. 
[07/13 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[07/13 11:59] <JimE_zOS> the tool won't let me apply an uncertified zap. 
[07/13 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> cool.. will that status be updated in the zap manager?
[07/13 11:59] <JimE_zOS> that said, in an emergency, I can go outside the tool and apply the zap myself. 
[07/13 12:00] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[07/13 12:00] <JimE_zOS> zap manager (ZM for short), yes, it will
[07/13 12:00] <triveni> but we are waiting 
[07/13 12:00] <triveni> will wait to get it certified 
[07/13 12:00] <JimE_zOS> yep....waiting
[07/13 12:00] <triveni> ok
[07/13 12:00] <JimE_zOS> I like the simplcity of the zap.  
[07/13 12:01] <JimE_zOS> replacing bad instruction with correct instruction of the same length. 
[07/13 12:01] <JimE_zOS> that keeps the goop in order. :-)
[07/13 12:02] <triveni> :)

[07/14 13:32] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[07/14 13:32] <JimE_zOS> had a power outage here last night. 
[07/14 13:32] <06Amit_ZOS> Howdy Jim!
[07/14 13:32] <JimE_zOS> and I'm still goofed 
[07/14 13:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah! so were you in the dark?????
[07/14 13:33] <triveni> Hey Jim
[07/14 13:33] <triveni> Come to the light..
[07/14 13:33] <triveni> Hehehe ;)
[07/14 13:33] <JimE_zOS> but that doesn't matter....we have a zap to install! 
[07/14 13:33] <triveni> ohh 
[07/14 13:33] <triveni> yes
[07/14 13:34] <triveni> what time will that be Jim..
[07/14 13:36] <JimE_zOS> let me forward some details to you both
[07/14 13:36] <JimE_zOS> and then we can talk about timing. 
[07/14 13:37] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[07/14 13:37] <JimE_zOS> note on its way to your inbox. 
[07/14 13:38] <JimE_zOS> inboxes, I guess I should say. 
[07/14 13:38] <triveni> got it 
[07/14 13:39] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/14 13:39] <JimE_zOS> k....then lets talk about prep
[07/14 13:40] <triveni> ok
[07/14 13:40] <JimE_zOS> which we can start now because we won't be changing anything in prod at this point. 
[07/14 13:40] <triveni> can we go to zapmanager
[07/14 13:40] <triveni> and check it
[07/14 13:40] <JimE_zOS> yep.....but let's talk first. 
[07/14 13:40] <triveni> ok
[07/14 13:41] <06Amit_ZOS> you in B1 Jim or are we doing it online?
[07/14 13:41] <JimE_zOS> sec....EK 
[07/14 13:43] <JimE_zOS> let me finish this MOC with EK and then we'll continue. 
[07/14 13:43] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[07/14 13:49] <JimE_zOS> almost ready
[07/14 13:49] <triveni>  ok
[07/14 13:53] <JimE_zOS> managers can be so chatty. 
[07/14 13:53] <triveni> hhaha
[07/14 13:54] <06Amit_ZOS> ;-)
[07/14 13:58] <JimE_zOS> k...sorry.....
[07/14 13:58] <JimE_zOS> zaps are kept in two datasets 
[07/14 13:58] <triveni> ok
[07/14 13:59] <JimE_zOS> one for development to build and certify
[07/14 14:00] <JimE_zOS> and one for us to use to implement. 
[07/14 14:00] <JimE_zOS> the RACF rules for those datasets are different, of course. 
[07/14 14:00] <triveni> oh
[07/14 14:00] <JimE_zOS> in the development dataset, Wayne and company have write authority
[07/14 14:00] <JimE_zOS> in our dataset, only we have write authority
[07/14 14:01] <triveni> ok do we need the dev dataset
[07/14 14:01] <JimE_zOS> which prevents somebody from altering a zap after it is certified without realizing that they are doing so. 
[07/14 14:01] <JimE_zOS> so.....we need to use ZM to move the zap to our dataset for us. 
[07/14 14:02] <triveni> ok
[07/14 14:02] <JimE_zOS> we could do it manually, of course, but the tool has built-in logic to do it for us. 
[07/14 14:02] <triveni> ok
[07/14 14:03] <JimE_zOS> so, since Triveni is on daytime call, why don't you start ZM and we'll let you do this first part. 
[07/14 14:03] <triveni> thanks Jim!!
[07/14 14:03] <JimE_zOS> you'll need to be on TSO C 
[07/14 14:03] <triveni> m dere
[07/14 14:04] <triveni> is it in applications
[07/14 14:04] <JimE_zOS> nope....not built into ISPF. 
[07/14 14:04] <06Amit_ZOS> type in tso zm
[07/14 14:04] <triveni> ok
[07/14 14:04] <JimE_zOS> this is a homegrown tool 
[07/14 14:04] <triveni> got in
[07/14 14:04] <JimE_zOS> yes, TSO ZM 
[07/14 14:04] <JimE_zOS> and we need to change teh status of a zap. 
[07/14 14:05] <triveni> sorry it shows error
[07/14 14:05] <JimE_zOS> so option 5
[07/14 14:05] <06Amit_ZOS> option 5
[07/14 14:05] <JimE_zOS> what errors? 
[07/14 14:05] <triveni> something stupid
[07/14 14:05] <triveni> Panel definition too large, greater than screen size.
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> her screen size definition apparently is not acceptable
[07/14 14:06] <JimE_zOS> interesting. 
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> i can do that part
[07/14 14:06] <JimE_zOS> so it would seem. 
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> she can do the later part
[07/14 14:06] <triveni> ok
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> im in option 5
[07/14 14:06] <JimE_zOS> are you trying to run your TSO session on a Apple(R) device? :-)
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[07/14 14:06] <06Amit_ZOS> she wishes!
[07/14 14:06] <JimE_zOS> k....Amit, option 5 is fine. 
[07/14 14:07] <triveni> yes..then it might not have thrown such erors
[07/14 14:07] <triveni> i ll follow amit 
[07/14 14:07] <JimE_zOS> you'll need the zap number. 
[07/14 14:07] <JimE_zOS> it is in the email thread. 
[07/14 14:07] <06Amit_ZOS> i have the zap id
[07/14 14:07] <JimE_zOS> a word about thsese: 
[07/14 14:07] <JimE_zOS> Z00319F
[07/14 14:08] <06Amit_ZOS> 'the libraries to choose from' field shows 2 as of now
[07/14 14:08] <JimE_zOS> the number is just a consequatively assigned number, the "F" at the end means LFD> 
[07/14 14:08] <JimE_zOS> "R" is SR
[07/14 14:08] <JimE_zOS> A is SA 
[07/14 14:08] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[07/14 14:08] * triveni_brb has joined #theRock
[07/14 14:08] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni_brb
[07/14 14:08] <JimE_zOS> so you can tell my looking at the zap number where the zap belongs
[07/14 14:08] <06Amit_ZOS> i had browsed the zap earlier, it has usefull comments as well
[07/14 14:09] <JimE_zOS> it does have nice comments. 
[07/14 14:09] <JimE_zOS> one of the reasons we use the tool 
[07/14 14:09] <JimE_zOS> we had something less formal years ago, but ZM makes things more consistant 
[07/14 14:10] <JimE_zOS> k....the zap is certified, so Amit, you'll want to "accept" it
[07/14 14:10] <06Amit_ZOS> so which library do i choose?
[07/14 14:10] <JimE_zOS> search both 
[07/14 14:10] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[07/14 14:10] <triveni_brb> B
[07/14 14:10] <JimE_zOS> but the zap should be coming from the #1 dataset. 
[07/14 14:10] <JimE_zOS> yep...."B"
[07/14 14:11] <06Amit_ZOS> what do i give the new codefix status as?
[07/14 14:11] <06Amit_ZOS> 2?
[07/14 14:12] <JimE_zOS> what is option 2 
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> Certified
[07/14 14:12] <triveni_brb> certified
[07/14 14:12] <JimE_zOS> I can't follow along
[07/14 14:12] <JimE_zOS> no....it is already certified. 
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> 1. Created....
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> 2. Certified
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> 3. Production
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> 4. No Fix
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS> New Code Fix Status:,_,1. Created....SPI Num,144184,
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS>                        2. Certified
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS>                        3. Production
[07/14 14:12] <06Amit_ZOS>                        4. No Fix
[07/14 14:12] <triveni_brb> currently its status is pending
[07/14 14:13] <JimE_zOS> we can't just accept it? 
[07/14 14:13] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[07/14 14:13] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[07/14 14:13] <JimE_zOS> sometimes this tool ticks me off. 
[07/14 14:13] <06Amit_ZOS> the code fix status says its currently 'pending'
[07/14 14:13] <JimE_zOS> k....then try production 
[07/14 14:14] <06Amit_ZOS> oh i think that was talking about the SPI # 144184,
[07/14 14:15] <triveni> its asking to Verify?
[07/14 14:15] <06Amit_ZOS> ok now the status change is accepted. the next step it says is to verify
[07/14 14:15] <JimE_zOS> yes, verify is fine. 
[07/14 14:16] <JimE_zOS> that will run a job to make sure that the "goop" looks like the zap expects it to look
[07/14 14:16] <JimE_zOS> but it doesn't change anything 
[07/14 14:17] <06Amit_ZOS> online system id is PROD and sub system is LFD... Verify only field says Y , and the zap id shown is correct
[07/14 14:17] <06Amit_ZOS> now if i hit return i guess it will run the job you said
[07/14 14:18] <06Amit_ZOS> its automatically submitted right? i dont have to do anything?
[07/14 14:18] <JimE_zOS> auto submitted 
[07/14 14:18] <JimE_zOS> and that is just fine for it to run 
[07/14 14:18] <triveni> lets check iof
[07/14 14:18] <JimE_zOS> won't hurt a thing
[07/14 14:18] <JimE_zOS> yep....IOF is a good thing to check
[07/14 14:20] <JimE_zOS> did it submit the job?  
[07/14 14:20] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/14 14:21] <06Amit_ZOS> all have run successfully
[07/14 14:21] <triveni> job id
[07/14 14:21] <triveni> please paste
[07/14 14:21] <JimE_zOS> what is the jobname, Amit.  I don't see the job. 
[07/14 14:21] <triveni> yes me too
[07/14 14:21] <triveni> i ddint see it
[07/14 14:21] <06Amit_ZOS> oh wait that was not it..
[07/14 14:22] <triveni> does he have access
[07/14 14:22] <triveni> to submit it
[07/14 14:22] <JimE_zOS> he certainly should have access. 
[07/14 14:22] <triveni> or does it take time to show up 
[07/14 14:23] <JimE_zOS> I can fix it, if not. 
[07/14 14:23] <JimE_zOS> shouldn't take time.  Very quick job

[07/14 21:19] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey!Sorry.. a bit late..
[07/14 21:20] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Amit. 
[07/14 21:20] <JimE_zOS> I've already done the live feed and applied the zap. 
[07/14 21:20] <JimE_zOS> stupid tool made me apply it by dataset name. 
[07/14 21:20] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah.. i saw the ticket
[07/14 21:20] <JimE_zOS> so one job for CL08 and one for CL09 
[07/14 21:21] <JimE_zOS> and then some reporting jobs to try to confirm that it had, in fact, been applied. 
[07/14 21:21] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. there was a zap manager doc which i got through charlie's cheat sheet.. maybe there is some help there for future zaps
[07/14 21:21] <06Amit_ZOS> anywhoo..
[07/14 21:21] <JimE_zOS> I think the help is to right my own tool 
[07/14 21:22] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. definitely ! we could do that!
[07/14 21:22] <JimE_zOS> so zap applied and I bounced LFD 80J and 97C 
[07/14 21:22] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. then the new code would be taken in both the source libs
[07/14 21:23] <JimE_zOS> well, the source will be changed by Wayne 
[07/14 21:24] <JimE_zOS> sometime before the next release. 
[07/14 21:24] <JimE_zOS> the zap changes teh execuatable (goop) 
[07/14 21:24] <06Amit_ZOS> so will you be monitoring diaries through 3 am?
[07/14 21:25] <JimE_zOS> I don't know that I'll be watching that long, but I have to be up for major maint. anyway 
[07/14 21:25] <JimE_zOS> so I'm here for awhile 
[07/14 21:25] <06Amit_ZOS> i will be going to the grocery store now, will be back in sometime.. i can monitor them once i come back
[07/14 21:26] <JimE_zOS> k....thanks. 
[07/14 21:26] <JimE_zOS> buy some crunchy food :-)

[07/14 22:54] <06Amit_ZOS> the diaries look good so far
[07/14 23:19] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Amit, wasn't watching. 
[07/14 23:20] <JimE_zOS> gotta keep in mind that with major maint stuff, all sorts of things are going to be down or goofed. 
[07/14 23:20] <JimE_zOS> so it'll be hard to tell issues from maint. 
[07/14 23:20] <JimE_zOS> that said, this change is simple. 
[07/14 23:20] <JimE_zOS> if you look at the instruction Wayne put in place, we are just comparing to a hardcoded number. 
[07/14 23:21] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure the final code won't look like that.
[07/14 23:21] <JimE_zOS> but the zap couldn't be easier.

[07/17 13:53] <JimE_zOS> not familiar with that abend, Amit. 
[07/17 13:53] <JimE_zOS> let me look at code a sec
[07/17 13:59] <JimE_zOS> did those abends continue beyond 3:55 AM, Amit? 
[07/17 13:59] <06Amit_zOS> not that i see
[07/17 13:59] <JimE_zOS> k...thanks
[07/17 14:02] <06Amit_zOS> there were some in cl 4 too..
[07/17 14:04] <06Amit_zOS> and i know that 10 am and 11 am hour are the busiest of the day but still for fwiw's... at 11:25 exactly for some reason, there are relatively high arts (>0.1s) on all clusters
[07/17 14:28] <JimE_zOS> I think I'm giong to ignore the DICRSV ablines for now, Amit. 
[07/17 14:28] <06Amit_zOS> yes.. they dont seem to brake anything yet and they havent occured again
[07/17 14:28] <JimE_zOS> response time always worries me, but when BG average respone time is .7s, it is hard to get too worried. 
[07/17 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> oh, BG avg is 0.7 s?????
[07/17 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> isnt that very fast for BG?
[07/17 14:29] <JimE_zOS> according to webI, yes
[07/17 14:30] <JimE_zOS> it depends. 
[07/17 14:30] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[07/17 14:30] <JimE_zOS> I've seen BG a little faster and I've seen it 100+s 
[07/17 14:30] <06Amit_zOS> ok..

[07/18 12:12] <JimE_zOS> the second ID is Diligence too. 
[07/18 12:13] <triveni> so not unix release related?
[07/18 12:13] <triveni> and where are you checking JIm.. Please tell me that..
[07/18 12:15] <JimE_zOS> in the diary datasets you created, Triveni. 
[07/18 12:15] <triveni> ok
[07/18 12:15] <JimE_zOS> it is unix related
[07/18 12:16] <triveni> ok

[07/18 12:16] <triveni> 03KTPG
[07/18 12:16] <triveni> should i mail them all the erors
[07/18 12:17] <JimE_zOS> hang on a sec
[07/18 12:17] <JimE_zOS> yes, we'll share, but I want to check a few things first. 
[07/18 12:17] <triveni> ok
[07/18 12:18] <JimE_zOS> and since you had trouble finding the abends, I'll run a second set of diaries. 
[07/18 12:18] <triveni> yeah just to crosscheck
[07/18 12:18] <JimE_zOS> exactly 
[07/18 12:18] <triveni> but these are the ones which will be correct,

[07/18 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> for fg
[07/18 12:30] <JimE_zOS> not for FABC. 
[07/18 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> ah..
[07/18 12:30] <06Amit_zOS> i forget
[07/18 12:31] <JimE_zOS> in prod, those numbers would be a concern. 
[07/18 12:31] <JimE_zOS> but FABC (with only two copies per cluster) just can't deal 
[07/18 12:31] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/18 12:31] <JimE_zOS> got a note ready for RD. 
[07/18 12:31] <JimE_zOS> shall I send? 
[07/18 12:31] <triveni> ok
[07/18 12:32] <06Amit_zOS> yeah, i was just wondering why i diddnt catch these today morning.. it was cz i had checked prod diaries
[07/18 12:33] <JimE_zOS> that'll give them something to consider 
[07/18 12:35] <06Amit_zOS> oh, we just need to report the excessive ablines is it? no need to explain them?
[07/18 12:35] <triveni> will they ask us to run dem again today for fabc?
[07/18 12:36] <06Amit_zOS> probably
[07/18 12:36] <triveni> yeah coz they have to clear prod tonight.
[07/18 12:42] <JimE_zOS> I don't know that we need to explain them, Triveni. 
[07/18 12:42] <JimE_zOS> just make them aware. 
[07/18 12:42] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/18 12:43] <JimE_zOS> in general, the diary check is asking us to validate that nothing bad happened to the environment. 
[07/18 12:43] <triveni> JIm i couldn't find the lfd faults
[07/18 12:43] <JimE_zOS> in this case, something bad did happen. 
[07/18 12:43] <triveni> which u sent
[07/18 12:43] <triveni> which dataset is urs
[07/18 12:43] <triveni> which i can refer
[07/18 12:43] <JimE_zOS> so, making them aware that there might be a release issue is good enough...for now
[07/18 12:43] <JimE_zOS> my diary datasets are STAGED.UEVANJR.*
[07/18 12:44] <JimE_zOS> STAGED.UEVANJR.CL01.DIARIES
[07/18 12:44] <JimE_zOS> STAGED.UEVANJR.CL02.DIARIES

[07/18 12:44] <triveni> STAGED.UEVANJR.CL09.DIARIES
[07/18 12:44] <triveni> is this the lfd one
[07/18 12:45] <triveni> i dont see the user G07G1J there
[07/18 12:45] <triveni> in the faults
[07/18 12:45] <JimE_zOS> that came from your dataset.
[07/18 12:46] <JimE_zOS> and that short number of FAULTS was kinda beside the point. 
[07/18 12:46] <triveni> ok
[07/18 12:46] <JimE_zOS> the ablines are attention getting. 
[07/18 12:47] <triveni> ok Jim.. but teh faults were not the latest runs.. I might have ran them earlier.. but that's fine..
[07/18 12:47] <triveni> I got the point..
[07/18 12:48] <triveni> will wait for their next page.. 
[07/18 12:55] <JimE_zOS> one more thing. 
[07/18 12:55] <06Amit_zOS> yes jim
[07/18 12:55] <JimE_zOS> had this been production, we would have continued to dig until we found the cause. 
[07/18 12:56] <06Amit_zOS> yeah
[07/18 12:56] <JimE_zOS> in FABC....with release testing, no such investigation is needed. 
[07/18 12:58] <triveni> ok
[07/18 13:04] <06Amit_zOS> its funny, when i ran the fabc diarires, never got anything (faults) on copy 85.. only 80 and 89 were there
[07/18 13:28] <JimE_zOS> gonna step away for some lunch 
[07/18 13:28] <JimE_zOS> won't be long. 
[07/18 13:29] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/18 14:34] <JimE_zOS> back 
[07/18 14:34] <JimE_zOS> did you miss me? :-)
[07/18 14:35] <06Amit_zOS> We, yes, the OLS, no
[07/18 14:35] <triveni> we always do!!
[07/18 14:35] <triveni> ;)
[07/18 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Jim, D8MXXW this guy is clocking high arts on pretty much all the clusters
[07/18 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> will look into smapi for him in a bit
[07/18 14:55] <JimE_zOS> I'd also be curious to see what Debbie's reports say 
[07/18 14:55] <JimE_zOS> regular offender? 
[07/18 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> not there in the abuser list
[07/18 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> checking debbies reports
[07/18 14:57] <JimE_zOS> not in the abuser list is good. 
[07/18 14:57] <JimE_zOS> but the ID could still be a regular offender
[07/18 14:57] <JimE_zOS> we don
[07/18 14:58] <JimE_zOS> we don't put everybody in the penalty box. 
[07/18 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[07/18 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> if he was, you would expect to see him in E88DSK50 right? he is not there
[07/18 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> he is in E88DSK20 though
[07/18 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> D8MXXW        0002542   00003607
[07/18 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> looking for what those fields mean
[07/18 15:02] <JimE_zOS> so if he is past runs, we might conclude he is a "regular" 
[07/18 15:03] <JimE_zOS> it might also be helpful to look-up the ID. 
[07/18 15:03] <JimE_zOS> might get a clue there.  Like "blah, blah, WSK, blah" 
[07/18 15:04] <triveni> so if we see someone for first time, we will let them continue.. if they cause trouble on frequent basis.. only then we will be putting them in penalty box..
[07/18 15:04] <triveni> and i guess discussing with wayne will be dere..

[07/18 15:07] <06Amit_zOS> isnt that how you look up the id?
[07/18 15:19] <JimE_zOS> no....owner is for a DB. 
[07/18 15:19] <JimE_zOS> like: owner 5900 
[07/18 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> ow
[07/18 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> right
[07/18 15:19] <JimE_zOS> I use the Roscoe RPF CE.IDRPT to look-up and ID 
[07/18 15:19] <JimE_zOS> there is also a casenet tool to do that. 
[07/18 15:20] <JimE_zOS> when I started, we only had the RPF so that's what I tend to use. 
[07/18 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> he is LEXDILG
[07/18 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> diligence i guess
[07/18 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> roseta user
[07/18 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> Ultimate Software
[07/18 15:24] <06Amit_zOS> i used the rpf
[07/18 15:26] <06Amit_zOS> Im happy not using unix...
[07/18 15:26] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[07/18 15:26] <JimE_zOS> not that Roscoe is a lot better than unix. 
[07/18 15:27] <06Amit_zOS> might not be but, looking up the password for casenet everytime is painful
[07/18 15:27] <06Amit_zOS> and im not good at maintaining too many passwords
[07/18 15:43] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, just out of curiosity, how many steps for you in a day on an average?
[07/18 15:49] <JimE_zOS> it depends on the day.  On weekends (or PTO), I'm likely to walk 8-12 miles 
[07/18 15:49] <JimE_zOS> on office days, closer to 4 miles. 
[07/18 15:49] <06Amit_zOS> and how many steps does that translate to?
[07/18 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> doesn't the fitbit quantify it in terms of steps?
[07/18 15:50] <JimE_zOS> it does, yes.
[07/18 15:50] <JimE_zOS> but my fitbit also shows tenths of a mile. 
[07/18 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> so how much do you think 10K steps is? 2 miles?
[07/18 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> 1 mile?
[07/18 15:51] <JimE_zOS> today, of example, I've walked 3843 steps which is 1.80 miles
[07/18 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> oh..
[07/18 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> cool!
[07/18 15:51] <JimE_zOS> stride length matters too, of course .
[07/18 15:51] <06Amit_zOS> yes.. understood
[07/18 15:52] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Jim.. 
[07/18 15:52] <JimE_zOS> my fitbit adjusts my distance by GPSing my stride. 
[07/18 15:52] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[07/18 15:52] <JimE_zOS> I think it has to be bluetooth linked to my phone to do that, BTW 
[07/18 15:53] <triveni> yes
[07/18 15:53] <06Amit_zOS> I see
[07/18 15:54] <triveni> tht's correct
[07/18 15:54] <06Amit_zOS> ok.. brb

[07/19 10:33] <02charlie> havent tried, lmc
[07/19 10:34] <06Amit_zOS> http://cert-grp5.lexis.com/research
[07/19 10:34] <02charlie> We are not able to process your request at this time. Please try again later. If you continue to experience difficulties, please contact your customer service representative. 
[07/19 10:35] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[07/19 10:35] <06Amit_zOS> so its not just me then
[07/19 10:36] <02charlie> nope
[07/19 10:36] <triveni> yes it shows application error
[07/19 10:41] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Debbie, what was the first and second column stand for when you list them by LexisID's in E88DSK20 
[07/19 10:42] <dsk_hbe> first column is the number of browse transactions, second is the number of docs within those transactions
[07/19 10:43] <06Amit_zOS> cool.. Thanks!
[07/19 10:43] <dsk_hbe> sure thing
[07/19 10:43] <06Amit_zOS> i didn't write that clearly 
[07/19 10:47] <dsk_hbe> I understood :-)
[07/19 10:59] <triveni> Debbie, i thought it was like, no. of transactions where the certain database like ONRQ is shown first
[07/19 10:59] <triveni> I meant the first column
[07/19 10:59] <06Amit_zOS> thats a different table
[07/19 10:59] <06Amit_zOS> within the same job
[07/19 11:00] <triveni> yes got it
[07/19 11:05] <dsk_hbe> yeah, Amit was askign about the new-ish report I recently added to the end of that job.  Recently we had a single user requested a crazy ton of docs so I wanted this report so they'd stand out better in my daily checking
[07/19 11:06] <triveni> ok debbie
[07/19 11:11] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[07/19 11:12] <06Amit_zOS> Hi Jim!
[07/19 11:12] <JimE_zOS> PBR issues last night kept me up until 5AM. 
[07/19 11:12] <JimE_zOS> so I'm a little bit slow this morning. 
[07/19 11:13] <02charlie> ugh
[07/19 11:13] <02charlie> i saw the page
[07/19 11:13] <JimE_zOS> not your typical PBR page. 
[07/19 11:13] <02charlie> well, the ticket, assumed the page
[07/19 11:13] <02charlie> wow
[07/19 11:13] <dsk_hbe> I can't wait to hear what this new problem was 
[07/19 11:14] <JimE_zOS> two trigger jobs (I've never seen that), data from 7/14 but mostly empty/bogus (never seen that either) 
[07/19 11:15] <JimE_zOS> my guess last night (and I think JimC has confirmed in a thread I'll forward) was that the issue is related to the major maintenance work done last weekend. 
[07/19 11:15] <dsk_hbe> wonderful
[07/19 11:15] <triveni> hi Jim
[07/19 11:16] <triveni> looked at those jobs.
[07/19 11:16] <triveni> they are running successfully now
[07/19 11:16] <triveni> did u made changes to something
[07/19 11:16] <triveni> one was s7222 abend
[07/19 11:17] <JimE_zOS> you aren't talking to me, right? 
[07/19 11:17] <triveni> if u changed the jcl for the next smooth run
[07/19 11:17] <02charlie> ugh
[07/19 11:17] <triveni> i wanted to know that
[07/19 11:18] <triveni>  EPBRUBRM
[07/19 11:18] <triveni> this job
[07/19 11:18] <JimE_zOS> oh....PBR. 
[07/19 11:18] <JimE_zOS> no, I changed no JCL. 
[07/19 11:19] <JimE_zOS> just cleaned up the mess made by the first (and bogus) trigger job. 
[07/19 11:19] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:19] <triveni> what's its name
[07/19 11:19] <JimE_zOS> released the second (and valid) trigger job and OPC took care of the rest. 
[07/19 11:19] <triveni> what's the first job name
[07/19 11:20] <JimE_zOS> both jobs have the same name....trigger jobs are always EPBRSTAT 
[07/19 11:20] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:20] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if we'll see the answers when he forwards the email chain, Triveni
[07/19 11:20] <JimE_zOS> which is NOT OPC submitted. 
[07/19 11:20] <JimE_zOS> it comes from the unix side PBR application when the EOD files are ready to be processed. 
[07/19 11:21] <triveni> oh yes coz i cant see that job in opc
[07/19 11:21] <triveni> eod application jobs starts from EPBRLSTC
[07/19 11:22] <JimE_zOS> but you can see the job in spool and in SAVRS 
[07/19 11:22] <triveni> ok 
[07/19 11:23] <triveni> i see one run in savrs
[07/19 11:23] <triveni> that too a clean run
[07/19 11:23] <triveni> EPBRSTAT 0145784 W        RC=0000 TUE 18 JUL 2017.199 02:00
[07/19 11:24] <JimE_zOS> both of this morning's job are still on spool 
[07/19 11:24] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[07/19 11:24] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[07/19 11:24] <JimE_zOS> EPBRSTAT jobs sit on spool for 12 hours before moving to SAVRS 
[07/19 11:25] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:25] <JimE_zOS> that is done to allow recovery actions, should they be needed. 
[07/19 11:25] <triveni> yeah i can see two runs in spool
[07/19 11:25] <JimE_zOS> which for prod just isn't cool 
[07/19 11:25] <triveni> Jim how did u know that triggered jobs were the problm
[07/19 11:25] <triveni> i mean the triggering job was the problem
[07/19 11:26] <JimE_zOS> a couple of reasons.  
[07/19 11:26] <JimE_zOS> first, they should never be two for prod (cert does have multiple triggers...never for prod) 
[07/19 11:26] <JimE_zOS> second, one of hte trigger jobs arrived before midnight.  Another no-no for prod. 
[07/19 11:27] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:27] <triveni> can that ever happen again.. 
[07/19 11:27] <triveni> can we apply something to prevent it in future..
[07/19 11:27] <triveni> any checks..
[07/19 11:27] <JimE_zOS> third, the date variable set by the first (before midnight/bogus) trigger job was 07/14.  Prod PBR should only ever set a date to the immediately prior day. 
[07/19 11:28] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:29] <JimE_zOS> the creation of the trigger job isn't our responsiblity.  It is a function of unix side PBR.  So, no, I can't make a change to address the creation of extra trigger jobs. 
[07/19 11:29] <triveni> Modifying field in variable-------------- JCLVVDFL=0718
[07/19 11:29] <triveni> yeah i can see in one job its
[07/19 11:29] <triveni> 0714
[07/19 11:30] <JimE_zOS> the mainframe side did the right thing....it failed. 
[07/19 11:30] <triveni> ok
[07/19 11:31] <triveni> wanted to know, how to check it was triggered
[07/19 11:31] <triveni> will opc show me 
[07/19 11:31] <JimE_zOS> and better yet, you now know the issue so you can do human stuff.  Way better than automation
[07/19 11:31] <triveni> for this application SE00PBREOD
[07/19 11:32] <triveni> that it's being triggered from outside
[07/19 11:32] <JimE_zOS> you lost me. 
[07/19 11:32] <JimE_zOS> oh, yes it is. 
[07/19 11:32] <triveni> which option
[07/19 11:32] <triveni> am trying to find
[07/19 11:32] <JimE_zOS> you probably don't know enough OPC to find the trail. 
[07/19 11:33] <JimE_zOS> when we talk about PBR (training session), we'll discuss that. 
[07/19 11:33] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/19 11:33] <triveni> ok coming to PBR
[07/19 11:33] <triveni> what it is
[07/19 11:33] <triveni> in one line if you can tell me
[07/19 11:34] <JimE_zOS> Pricing, Billing and Royalty.  Billing being the important part to us. 
[07/19 11:34] <triveni> ok.. so i assume its one of the important applications
[07/19 11:34] <triveni> as its billing 
[07/19 11:35] <JimE_zOS> near the top of the list, yes. 
[07/19 11:35] <triveni> ok..
[07/19 11:35] <triveni> Looking forward for the training session :)
[07/19 11:35] <JimE_zOS> and it gets more important the closer we are to teh end of hte month. 
[07/19 11:35] <triveni> yes i can understand that..
[07/19 11:35] <triveni> Thanks Jim!!
[07/19 11:36] <JimE_zOS> PBR issue in the middle of hte month, less critical.  PBR issue at the end of hte month and people go crazy
[07/19 11:36] <triveni> ohh
[07/19 11:36] <triveni> so v r safe for now
[07/19 11:36] <JimE_zOS> this was a good day for a PBR issue, yes
[07/19 11:37] <triveni> :)
[07/19 11:37] <JimE_zOS> 10 days from now....not so much 
[07/19 11:37] <triveni> true
[07/19 11:40] <triveni> Thanks Jim for the mail.. It looks v helpful..
[07/19 12:04] <JimE_zOS> rename cancellation coming our way. 
[07/19 12:04] <JimE_zOS> stepping away to make some coffee.

[07/19 12:45] <triveni> done!!
[07/19 12:45] <triveni> opc apps deleted
[07/19 12:45] <02charlie> yep, looks good
[07/19 12:45] <triveni> cool!!
[07/19 12:48] <triveni> Debbie, long back you told me a command to check what i did so far in opc
[07/19 12:48] <triveni> m trying to find that
[07/19 12:48] <dsk_hbe> look for your notes on eqqaudio
[07/19 12:48] <triveni> ok
[07/19 12:49] <dsk_hbe> if you can't find anything, let me know and I'll explain it agan
[07/19 12:49] <triveni> yes found ur mail
[07/19 12:49] <triveni> thanks
[07/19 12:49] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[07/19 12:51] <triveni> oh yeah and it takes time to run the report
[07/19 12:51] <dsk_hbe> yeah, a bit, not terribly long
[07/19 12:51] <triveni> yup, got it..
[07/19 12:51] <triveni> thanks debbie!!
[07/19 12:58] <02charlie> debbie, do you have a link for a map of the ta applications?
[07/19 13:00] <dsk_hbe> not sure what you mean there, Charlie?
[07/19 13:02] <02charlie> i can see that qbrws is running but qsrchsrvr is not in cdc5
[07/19 13:03] <02charlie> and none of us had been able to get into fabc ldc
[07/19 13:03] <dsk_hbe> I suspect it is a diffrent problem than TA if you can't get logged in.  Let me see if Ic an find where I had something similar that JimC fixed once
[07/19 13:04] <02charlie> and now i'm getting a 503 error
[07/19 13:04] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, cdc6 and cdc7 also use fabc as backend, but I hardly ever use any of these so can't say if they will work any better
[07/19 13:09] <dsk_hbe> not finding the conversation with JimC so it must have been in skype, but I'd ask him directly
[07/19 13:09] <dsk_hbe> looks like he was disconnected when you asked before
[07/19 13:11] <dsk_hbe> you want to say cdc5 specifically... fabc is used for many different platforms
[07/19 13:14] <triveni> brb
[07/19 13:34] <triveni> back
[07/19 14:09] <02charlie> and cdc6 is happy now too
[07/19 14:21] <02charlie> anybody know what jobs take the detail files and produce the html for tha abline reports, especially in fabc?
[07/19 14:23] <02charlie> eg E99ABURL creates the data file for the STAGEW datasets STAGEW.NE00.LTAED.FABC.ABLINE.DETAIL and STAGEW.NE00.LTAED.FABC.ABLINE.STATS 
[07/19 14:23] <dsk_hbe> nope, that's a messy process that I have never spent a lot of time looking at.
[07/19 14:23] <dsk_hbe> Portman wrote it
[07/19 14:23] <02charlie> but something must take those files and do more with them to create the html
[07/19 14:24] <02charlie> ah, portman, thx. i thought it was TT
[07/19 14:25] <triveni> charlie.. tell us as well when u get to know..
[07/19 14:25] <dsk_hbe> TT maybe was involved too... I dunno... it wasn't created within our group
[07/19 14:25] <dsk_hbe> Amit and Triveni, Wayne has requested that we move this ID down to .70 in the abuser cards.  Can you do that for us?
[07/19 14:25] <dsk_hbe> 2 ABUSER015 .80 80WW0F
[07/19 14:26] <02charlie> sure. anita is complaining the ablines i saw in fabc lcre yesterday didnt show up in the abline report
[07/19 14:26] <dsk_hbe> Lets make sure Jim is coolw ith it.
[07/19 14:26] <02charlie> http://syswip/ds/Ablines/abendsum_fabc.htm
[07/19 14:26] <triveni> sure debbie!!
[07/19 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> I can do that
[07/19 14:26] <dsk_hbe> confirm with JimE first
[07/19 14:26] <triveni> ok Amit!!
[07/19 14:28] <06Amit_zOS> Yup.. will wait for Jim's approval
[07/19 14:29] <triveni> charlie..so is there something wrong with the fabc report logic..
[07/19 14:29] <02charlie> probably
[07/19 14:29] <triveni> ok
[07/19 14:29] <02charlie> sounds like it's on the sysw side
[07/19 14:30] <02charlie> and in bob p's hands
[07/19 14:30] <triveni> ok

[07/19 15:06] <JimE_zOS> stupid piece of crap.  (chanserv) 
[07/19 15:06] <JimE_zOS> I miss X2. 
[07/19 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[07/19 15:07] <JimE_zOS> chanserv thought it would be cool to auto-ban me. 
[07/19 15:07] <06Amit_zOS> X2... more stuff i dont know
[07/19 15:07] <JimE_zOS> X2 is gone, Amit, so I don't think we need to train you on that. 
[07/19 15:07] <JimE_zOS> it was just an irc control tool 
[07/19 15:08] <06Amit_zOS> very Rad
[07/19 15:08] <JimE_zOS> but like many things around here, we "upgraded" to something that doesn't work as well as what we had.
[07/19 15:08] <06Amit_zOS> did i use that correctly?
[07/19 15:08] <06Amit_zOS> (Rad)
[07/19 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[07/19 15:09] <JimE_zOS> isn't Triveni our "cool" expert? 
[07/19 15:09] <dsk_hbe> Rad is not of my generation ;-)
[07/19 15:09] <JimE_zOS> I still use "cool" and "neato" so I'm pretty sure I'm not the expert
[07/19 15:10] <dsk_hbe> Jim, are you ok if the kids make an abuser change that Wayne requested?  CHanging the REPrisk ID (80ww0f) from .80 to .70?
[07/19 15:10] <JimE_zOS> by all means. 
[07/19 15:10] <06Amit_zOS> Rad was coined by Jim, Debbie.. So i thought it is of your generation!
[07/19 15:10] <JimE_zOS> how about .65 ? :-)
[07/19 15:11] <06Amit_zOS> cool..
[07/19 15:11] <06Amit_zOS> creating the change
[07/19 15:11] <dsk_hbe> ;-) they may earn lower than .70 before it's all said and done... they can't seem to stop submitting dup searches

[07/19 15:17] <06Amit_zOS> scheduling for 2am to 2:15 am tomorrow morning
[07/19 15:17] <JimE_zOS> k....very good. 
[07/19 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, your last fcard set in P$170713 is not entered in the History file...
[07/19 15:23] <06Amit_zOS> is it okay to copy that file or do I need to copy over the older one on P$170629
[07/19 15:32] <06Amit_zOS> Debbie, the fcard member is ready to be subb'd
[07/19 15:33] <06Amit_zOS> PZ00.SS.CONFIG.FCARDS.PROD(P$170720)
[07/19 15:33] <dsk_hbe> to answer it for yourself, Amit, do a 3.12 compare of the two members to see what changed and then the likely change will be present in the diary
[07/19 15:33] <dsk_hbe> If you are asking me to check something, I prefer doing it when you have totally completed your work.  You can always rerun if I find something wrong.  However, I may not be here much longer so anyone else will be just as good at checking
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS> 7/12/2017 JRE - Changed name of ORACLEDB from jlfdprodA to jlfdprodB to
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS>                 address Oracle side inventory corruption found by Anita.
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS>                 While preparing this fix, I noticed that DW points to a
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS>                 DIFFERENT Oracle row that does NOT actually exist.
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS>                 Anita believes that is OK because DW does not run
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS>                 JDButil.
[07/19 15:38] <06Amit_zOS> that was the difference
[07/19 15:39] <06Amit_zOS> and i believe that still holds good
[07/19 15:39] <dsk_hbe> I assume you just dind't paste the part other than the comments
[07/19 15:39] <dsk_hbe> yes it very much does... you will find the jlfdprodb in the lfd diary messages
[07/19 15:40] <triveni_brb> back
[07/19 15:41] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[07/19 15:43] <JimE_zOS> sorry for the history lapse. 
[07/19 15:44] <dsk_hbe> you had it... just in the fcards themselves!
[07/19 15:44] <JimE_zOS> but I think there is a flaw in your process, Amit.  You should ALWAYS start with what you think is the right member, run it and compare to live prod. 
[07/19 15:44] <JimE_zOS> if those are identicial, you know you are starting wit the right base. 
[07/19 15:45] <dsk_hbe> I don't do that :-}  I run my changes and compare to live prod after that
[07/19 15:45] <JimE_zOS> ie, I would never take the high dated member and assume that I start from there. 
[07/19 15:45] <dsk_hbe> now if it was a complex change... I bet I'd have liked your starting point first ;-)
[07/19 15:45] <JimE_zOS> so you get there at the end rather than the beginning 
[07/19 15:45] <JimE_zOS> potato, patato 
[07/19 15:45] <JimE_zOS> as long as a compare is run at some point, I guess I don't care. 
[07/19 15:46] <JimE_zOS> but my warning about assuming that the last member is your starting point stands.  
[07/19 15:46] <dsk_hbe> the good thing to remember here though in both methods is that you can rerun them as often as needed... I think that is what makes the kids think they need to have things checked mid-way.  You just don't have to !
[07/19 15:46] <06Amit_zOS> ok.. so you mean to run a compare of the LPASA files?
[07/19 15:47] <06Amit_zOS> E1P0FCDB,J148980
[07/19 15:47] <06Amit_zOS> E1P1FCDC,J149495

[07/19 15:47] <06Amit_zOS> E1P4FCDC,J149622
[07/19 15:47] <JimE_zOS> I mean run the job for teh member you think is your starting point.  That will create prep datasets and those should match EXACTLY to the live dtasets 
[07/19 15:47] <JimE_zOS> if not, you are starting with the wrong base. 
[07/19 15:47] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[07/19 15:47] <06Amit_zOS> makes sense
[07/19 15:49] <dsk_hbe> I need to head out but if you are all done, Amit, I can check things first
[07/19 15:49] <06Amit_zOS> Im done
[07/19 15:50] <dsk_hbe> k, checking
[07/19 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> the above are the jobs i ran
[07/19 15:50] <dsk_hbe> yeah, always the same ;-)
[07/19 15:52] <dsk_hbe> you don't have it scheduled in OPC yet,... you're slowing me down ;-)
[07/19 15:52] <02charlie> :)
[07/19 15:54] <dsk_hbe> everything looks fine except no OPC schedule yet.  I need to go.  Charlie, can you check that after he's done for me?
[07/19 15:54] <02charlie> yes
[07/19 15:54] <02charlie> go debbie

[07/19 15:57] <02charlie> k, thx
[07/19 15:57] <triveni> bye debbie!!
[07/19 16:10] <06Amit_zOS> Everything look ok Charlie?
[07/19 16:10] <02charlie> oh, yes, i thought i said that
[07/19 16:10] <02charlie> [07/19 15:57] <charlie> k, thx (was intended for you)
[07/19 16:11] <02charlie> (amdn meant everything was ok)
[07/19 16:11] <02charlie> sorry, i sometimes am WAY too terse
[07/19 16:14] <triveni>  use 3.12 and compare via pl00.lrisa.recf(*)... that compares all members of the dataset... then on the second screen enter the prod pl00.lpasa.recf
[07/19 16:14] <triveni> amit..do this.. just to be sure.
[07/19 16:19] <06Amit_zOS> done. thanks!
[07/19 16:21] <triveni> Anytime!!
[07/19 16:22] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I prefer teh compare job already in the F-Card source dataset 
[07/19 16:22] <JimE_zOS> just submit COMPARE
[07/19 16:22] <JimE_zOS> done.
[07/19 16:22] <06Amit_zOS> i did both jim
[07/19 16:23] <JimE_zOS> that should make the interactive compare unneeded. 
[07/19 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> i
[07/19 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> ww
[07/19 16:23] <JimE_zOS> use your words :-)
[07/19 16:24] <02charlie> :)
[07/19 16:24] <06Amit_zOS> was copying charlies wrong window approach!
[07/19 16:24] <02charlie> with all the noise that's been around here, i think i used up my quotient :)
[07/19 16:25] <06Amit_zOS> and i had to figure out ww was wrong window
[07/19 16:25] <02charlie> who posted in the wrong window? i havent done that since this morning :)
[07/19 16:25] <06Amit_zOS> and i agree jim, compare job is much easier..
[07/19 16:26] <06Amit_zOS> but since i hadn't tried the 3.12 or 3.13 before, i wanted to give it a go
[07/19 16:26] <JimE_zOS> good tools 
[07/19 16:26] <JimE_zOS> I use them too. 
[07/19 16:26] <JimE_zOS> so good to try them out
[07/19 16:27] <JimE_zOS> the thing you have to worry about, however, is that sometimes TSO based tools put an RESERVE against an entire VOLUME
[07/19 16:27] <JimE_zOS> we've had TSO based tools hurt PCS before. 
[07/19 16:27] <JimE_zOS> so I try to refrain from using tools like these directly against live OLS datasets. 
[07/19 16:28] <06Amit_zOS> reserve is different from enqueue?
[07/19 16:28] <JimE_zOS> yes, it is. 
[07/19 16:28] <JimE_zOS> RESERVE is a hardware thing. 
[07/19 16:28] <06Amit_zOS> i see.. 
[07/19 16:29] <JimE_zOS> while ENQUEUE is a software thing which is usually done at teh dataset level. 
[07/19 16:29] <JimE_zOS> the OLS ignores enqueues because LEXIS doesn't use ZOS I/O services. 
[07/19 16:30] <JimE_zOS> a hardware RESERVE, however, can't be ignored. 
[07/19 16:32] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[07/19 16:34] <JimE_zOS> speaking of RESERVE, Storage Eng. has failed me.  I expected to have new NWRK volumes this week. 
[07/19 16:34] <JimE_zOS> and, so far, not so much 
[07/19 16:34] <JimE_zOS> let me see what I can do about that. 
[07/19 16:35] <02charlie> looks like jimc is rebooting the cdc5 box
[07/19 16:53] <06Amit_zOS> have a Good night guys
[07/19 16:53] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away

[07/20 09:11] * Topic is 'Rule#1: Debbie is always right!'
[07/20 09:11] * Set by ChanServ on Fri May 12 11:17:17
[07/20 09:11] * ChanServ sets mode: +o Amit_ZOS
[07/20 09:11] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning folks!
[07/20 09:34] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[07/20 09:34] <dsk_hbe> morning
[07/20 09:43] <triveni> morning debbie!!
[07/20 09:43] * charlie has joined #theRock
[07/20 09:43] * ChanServ sets mode: +o charlie
[07/20 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> There was an early morning page today too!
[07/20 09:44] <dsk_hbe> for Jim?  Did he get paged on the cat call?
[07/20 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> Im sure he did
[07/20 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> cz i did too
[07/20 09:45] <dsk_hbe> :-/
[07/20 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> and i saw that it was to join the conference call
[07/20 09:45] <02charlie> it didnt say what the call was about?
[07/20 09:45] <dsk_hbe> when scidir is involved, I have to believe it's not going to end up being ours to deal with... but some folks can't seem to make those kinds of connections :-(
[07/20 09:46] <dsk_hbe> INC01593657 per email
[07/20 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> INC01593657
[07/20 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/20 09:47] <02charlie> i dont appear to have gotten any email
[07/20 09:47] <dsk_hbe> I have no idea why you would have been paged too, Amit, unless they just paged anyone and everyone that is listed in xmatters no matter the shift :-/
[07/20 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> it had a message saying " Please join the major incident conference bridge for multiple products including ldc
[07/20 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> "
[07/20 09:48] <dsk_hbe> forwarded the bridge email to you Charlie... there were a couple others too
[07/20 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> no, i have added myself to all other shifts to shadow the oncaller
[07/20 09:48] <dsk_hbe> news to me, ok.
[07/20 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> so when the oncaller is paged, i am to
[07/20 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> too*
[07/20 09:50] <02charlie> thx debbie
[07/20 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> what was wrong with scidir? and why would it be ours debbie??
[07/20 09:54] <dsk_hbe> it's not ours which was my point... if something like this includes scidir and LA, then the odds of them needing to wake us up are pretty slim.  We don't support those, they don't use the MVS world at all
[07/20 09:55] <dsk_hbe> so to your first question... I have no idea and don't care ;-)
[07/20 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[07/20 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> but what was that 'including ldc' part in that page talking about... any idea?
[07/20 09:58] <dsk_hbe> not sure exactly what you are asking, but if the list of affected systems includes ldc, rosetta, etc... things that we might indeed be able to help with but *also* includes scidir and LA... odds are very slim that the root cause of the issue is anything we can help with.  I suspect it was a network related issue.
[07/20 09:59] <dsk_hbe> that's abotu the only thing that would affect all of those products at the same time
[07/20 09:59] <06Amit_ZOS> perfect..
[07/20 09:59] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks!
[07/20 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> and on a totally different topic, what do you have for breakfast Debbie!?
[07/20 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> ;-)
[07/20 10:00] <dsk_hbe> I had Life cereal ;-)
[07/20 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. through grad studies, cereal was the only constant thing in my life!
[07/20 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> im trying to figure out a healthy breakfast
[07/20 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> was having maple and brown sugar oats for a while untill recently i decided its too sugary..
[07/20 10:03] <dsk_hbe> What I shoudl have is protein... eggs... but I don't always plan ahead and boil themt he night before.  That is the best thign for me, though... no carbs and protein to keep me from munching later
[07/20 10:04] <dsk_hbe> Oats is a great breakfast too but I can't eat them int he summer... too hot.  I'm diabetic and oats is one of the things that they say is REALLY good for diabetics.  I often grind them up in a protein shake to get them when it's too hot to eat them cooked
[07/20 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> boiled egg is good.. do you discard the yolk? its almost full of cholestrol and fat right?
[07/20 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> generally the actuall good oats have no taste whatsoever,  I cannot imagine having them without any sugar
[07/20 10:07] <dsk_hbe> I don't... weight and cholesterol aren't a huge problem for me though.  I've read recently that the yolks aren't as big a concern as they once were thought to be
[07/20 10:07] <02charlie> i understand cinnamon will interfere with sugar uptake 
[07/20 10:08] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 368 seconds)
[07/20 10:08] <dsk_hbe> when I eat oats, I have to have sugar too, but try to at most stick with the splenda blend brown sugar
[07/20 10:09] <dsk_hbe> yeah, my sister, also diabetic, pours mountains of cinnamin on her oatmeal... I can only take so much but do try to use it
[07/20 10:09] <02charlie> you could try a savory oat disk also
[07/20 10:09] <dsk_hbe> not a fan
[07/20 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> mountains of cinnamon..LOL
[07/20 10:10] <dsk_hbe> but you may have meant that for Amit....though I'm still nto a fan ;-)
[07/20 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> Charlie! Do you add salt to the oats?
[07/20 10:11] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/20 10:11] <02charlie> well, duh! :) of course! :)
[07/20 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> I once when i joined here, i think on the first day, i added salt to the original flaker oats instead of sugar.. it was the most difficult thing that i had to do is to finish that bowl without trashing it
[07/20 10:12] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[07/20 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> hats off to you charlie!
[07/20 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> you'd be the last persont to have sodium defficiency
[07/20 10:13] <02charlie> salt is one of my main food groups :)

[07/20 10:16] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[07/20 10:16] <dsk_hbe> I once got to watch Charlie pour salt on a lemon slice and eat it... it still boggles my mind ;-)
[07/20 10:16] <02charlie> good morning triveni
[07/20 10:16] <triveni> morning Charlie!!
[07/20 10:17] <02charlie> i think that was sugar debbie, but i will use salt if i'm drinking tequila
[07/20 10:17] <triveni> hehehe
[07/20 10:17] <triveni> me too charlie..
[07/20 10:18] <triveni> ;)
[07/20 10:18] <dsk_hbe> I woudl have sworn it was salt... but I stand corrected and it still boggles my mind... since my memory failed me I will have to ask... didn't you actually eat the rind as well?
[07/20 10:19] <02charlie> yes
[07/20 10:19] <dsk_hbe> boggling ;-)
[07/20 10:19] <02charlie> :)
[07/20 10:21] <02charlie> my youngest grandson (Rhys, 3yrs 1 month old) took a bottle of RealLemon lemon juice, popped a straw in, and drank from it like it was water
[07/20 10:22] <dsk_hbe> yikes... they say too much is bad for your teeth... but hopefully he'll not do that once he has his adult teeth ;-)
[07/20 10:23] <triveni> hahaha 
[07/20 10:36] <02charlie> triveni, you need to complete the tasks, close the change, and let ops know its ready to be closed
[07/20 10:37] <triveni> ok
[07/20 10:41] <triveni> done.
[07/20 10:42] <triveni> i ll close the incident as well
[07/20 10:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, where can i find the transaction codes and their meanings debbie
[07/20 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> trans codes in you jobs
[07/20 10:43] <dsk_hbe> if I know what you mean by that, I think you are asking for the flodsect which you shodul find in any of the LFD or LSR MACLIBs via LMS on rosW
[07/20 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> got it
[07/20 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks
[07/20 10:45] <dsk_hbe> look for the list under flowtrnt
[07/20 10:47] <06Amit_ZOS> and you have the decimal equivalent of these in your job.. i remember you telling me
[07/20 10:47] <06Amit_ZOS> sorry for these repeat questions debbie
[07/20 10:48] <dsk_hbe> not a problem!!!
[07/20 10:51] <dsk_hbe> ya know how when you get an automated call preceding hooking you up to a customer service rep and thent he rep gets ont he line and says 'how may I help you'... I want to scream 'you called me!'... it's all I can do not to... it's the little things in life that drive me crazy ;-)
[07/20 10:52] <triveni> hahhaa.. i can relate to that feeling..
[07/20 10:53] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/20 10:57] <02charlie> omg, the agile people dont know what is meant by swag
[07/20 10:58] <02charlie> ok, 1-on-1
[07/20 10:59] <triveni> haahhha
[07/20 10:59] <triveni> did use swag
[07/20 10:59] <triveni> wow
[07/20 11:00] <triveni> let Jim come.. i ll ask him..
[07/20 11:00] <triveni> ;)
[07/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> I think you could have stopped after "the agile people don't know." 
[07/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[07/20 11:23] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[07/20 11:23] <triveni> hahhaa
[07/20 11:23] <triveni> Hi Jim
[07/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> back from 9am meeting to discuss some access request I keep rejecting because they are way stupid. 
[07/20 11:24] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim
[07/20 11:24] <JimE_zOS> so, if you folks are good, I'll start my drive to the office. 
[07/20 11:24] <dsk_hbe> good here
[07/20 11:25] <JimE_zOS> since she is the boss, I'll take that as an all clear. 
[07/20 11:25] <JimE_zOS> on the way 
[07/20 11:25] <JimE_zOS> bye!

[07/20 12:47] <06Amit_zOS> hey!
[07/20 12:49] <06Amit_zOS> how many is too many for FDBULK in cluster 8?
[07/20 12:49] <06Amit_zOS> jpmc guy on a roll
[07/20 12:50] <dsk_hbe> kpmg?  he gets what he deserves ;-)
[07/20 12:50] <06Amit_zOS> sorry kpmg
[07/20 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> oh, is that because he was being 'managed'?
[07/20 12:51] <dsk_hbe> I think honestly that we just can't handle his excessive load during the bridge window.  If Jim is ever allowed time to make the changes he wants there, he may have better liuck
[07/20 12:51] <dsk_hbe> I haven't looked at yesterday's stats yet, but if you look at my e88dsk50 report... I think the last report... and see him in there then yeah
[07/20 12:52] <06Amit_zOS> i checked yours.. he is a popular guy
[07/20 12:52] <dsk_hbe> yeah ;-)
[07/20 12:53] <JimE_zOS> popular or infamous? 
[07/20 12:53] <dsk_hbe> hey Jim, I created PE00.LPAED.ECLIPSE.LSD.D170721.CARDS for input into tonight's e00llsd0 to delete 5 more users off the eclipse file... just fyi
[07/20 12:53] <dsk_hbe> infamous is probably a much better word ;-)
[07/20 12:53] <triveni> and now defamed
[07/20 12:53] <JimE_zOS> k....very good.  Thanks. 
[07/20 12:54] <06Amit_zOS> yes, i was going for the sarcastic popular
[07/20 12:55] <06Amit_zOS> anyone attending the xplore call?? (Intelligize)
[07/20 12:55] <02charlie> yep
[07/20 12:55] <dsk_hbe> no, I was too busy still catchign up on email
[07/20 13:15] <JimE_zOS> I missed my chance to donate blood this morning so I think I'll wonder over and see if they will take me as a walk-in
[07/20 13:15] <JimE_zOS> back when I can. 
[07/20 13:17] <triveni> ok Jim
[07/20 13:22] <dsk_hbe> fyi, Wayne is sending over a couple change requests for MFR limit changes for my oncall week.  I'll take ownership when they come and we can change that when the time comes if Amit or Triveni want to make the changes.  For now I'll own them so I don't forget
[07/20 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> Oh yes!
[07/20 13:24] <06Amit_zOS> sure..

[07/20 16:34] <triveni> gn debbie!!
[07/20 16:36] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, so we are using 7 volumes per cluster for the 32 extents, when we reduce the number of extents to 16 we are NOT increasing the number of volumes right?
[07/20 16:39] <triveni> Jim.. i think i have a good idea.. how we will code.. i ll just need the volume names.. probably v can discuss wen we meet next time..
[07/20 16:41] <triveni> the mail gives me this info LNx9PA  LNx9PP
[07/20 16:43] <triveni> so it will be 4 volumes per cluster
[07/20 16:43] <triveni> i guess..
[07/20 16:44] <triveni> sorry it could be 16.. not sure.. will wait for Jim to answer
[07/20 16:45] <triveni> the mail says 16 3390-9s per cluster labeled LNx9PA  LNx9PP
[07/20 16:45] <triveni> so yes its 16 per cluster
[07/20 16:53] <02charlie> i'm going to wander into ops, looking for justin
[07/20 17:00] <06Amit_zOS> G&Q night all!

[07/21 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Charlie
[07/21 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> what's shiboleth metadata guys? 
[07/21 10:03] <dsk_hbe> I don't know
[07/21 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> some special products metadata?
[07/21 10:04] <06Amit_ZOS> not for us to worry i believe.. SE00SHIBUPDATE in error list
[07/21 10:04] <02charlie> im guessing it has something to do security, but you're right, not ours
[07/21 10:05] <02charlie> it's middleware
[07/21 10:05] <dsk_hbe> btw, cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese today ;-)
[07/21 10:05] <02charlie> see the 10am t/o note
[07/21 10:06] <02charlie> almost sounds tasty
[07/21 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> nice! but what about protien!??
[07/21 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> you'l need to cover that in the rest two meals1`
[07/21 10:06] <dsk_hbe> I'm hoping the cream cheese holds me... some days eggs just sound nasty
[07/21 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> Triveni has made some 'Upma' for me.. looked really tasty!
[07/21 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> gonna hog that in later
[07/21 10:07] <02charlie> i have a head full of something, so at the moment, nothing sounds good
[07/21 10:07] <dsk_hbe> what is that?
[07/21 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> thick porridge from dry roasted semolina or coarse rice flour
[07/21 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> with some veggies and spices..
[07/21 10:08] <dsk_hbe> I could eat that :-)
[07/21 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> Yeah, its one of her best recipies!
[07/21 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> you should try that! really yum!
[07/21 10:09] <02charlie> what spices?
[07/21 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> You'l need to ask her.. its her trade secret i guess..
[07/21 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> she won't tell me how to replicate that exactly, i tried once....disaster..
[07/21 10:11] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[07/21 10:13] <triveni>  It just comes out good in fluke. 
[07/21 10:13] <triveni> It all depends on my mood. ;)
[07/21 10:13] <02charlie> :)
[07/21 10:13] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/21 11:05] <triveni> debbie, i checked that job E00LLSD0
[07/21 11:05] <triveni> so will it remove the eclipse users as mentioned in ur cards
[07/21 11:05] <dsk_hbe> you didn't find a ton in it did you? :-)
[07/21 11:06] <triveni> no
[07/21 11:06] <triveni> v less
[07/21 11:06] <triveni> 6 users 
[07/21 11:06] <triveni> as i can see in the cards
[07/21 11:06] <dsk_hbe> yep, the job runs while the eclipse file is locked so the users are completely removed fromt eh job during the job run.  that many fewer of our locked seacrhes filling up PCS HCP
[07/21 11:07] <dsk_hbe> *'removed from the file'
[07/21 11:07] <triveni> ok
[07/21 11:08] <triveni> so now they won't be able to perform searches?
[07/21 11:08] <dsk_hbe> only 11 users left and Eric is trying to track down an ok to delete them.  They all belong to customer service type functions so odds are good they will beokay with us deleting them
[07/21 11:08] <triveni> ok
[07/21 11:08] <dsk_hbe> these users still could add more searches to the file, but all fo the ones I got okays from to remove their searches hadn't used the classic system in years
[07/21 11:09] <triveni> ohh ok
[07/21 11:10] <triveni> Thanks debbie.
[07/21 11:10] <dsk_hbe> sure!

[07/24 10:11] <02charlie> morning jim

[07/24 10:53] <02charlie> same here
[07/24 11:03] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/24 11:04] <06Amit_zOS> Well i guess soon, we will be taking 80ww0f off since we are going to cut him off alltogether!
[07/24 11:04] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[07/24 11:05] <dsk_hbe> yep... bad boy!
[07/24 11:05] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[07/24 11:06] <dsk_hbe> I have that email chain he showed part of if you want to see it?
[07/24 11:06] <06Amit_zOS> sure! I'd like to see it
[07/24 11:07] <06Amit_zOS> and i guess no-one cares about the shibolleth update since its failing daily since the last four days
[07/24 11:07] <dsk_hbe> there you go
[07/24 11:07] <06Amit_zOS> thanks debbie!
[07/24 11:17] <06Amit_zOS> thats some juicy bussiness gossip debbie!! loved it!
[07/24 11:19] <dsk_hbe> yeah, stuff we don't usually get to hear
[07/24 11:25] <06Amit_zOS> getting something to eat..
[07/24 11:25] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[07/24 11:25] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[07/24 12:21] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/24 13:48] <JimE_zOS> how is this for silly.  A bunch of users are complaining because they can't use TSO edit.  (which isn't true, BTW).  So they included a screen grab showing that edit doesn't work.  They are trying to edit a VISF dataset (DUMB!) and the message they get is "Browse Substituted" (DUMBER!).  
[07/24 13:48] <dsk_hbe> :-D
[07/24 13:49] <02charlie> 8-O
[07/24 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[07/24 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> im guessing a VISF is a system dataset they arent suppose to edit
[07/24 14:05] <JimE_zOS> it is a content dataset, Amit. 
[07/24 14:05] <JimE_zOS> but it is in a goofy format 
[07/24 14:05] <JimE_zOS> (our format) 
[07/24 14:05] <JimE_zOS> and we have a tool to edit it (Urbana) 
[07/24 14:05] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[07/24 14:05] <JimE_zOS> which we created for this very purpose. 
[07/24 14:09] <JimE_zOS> oh, and I love this: 
[07/24 14:09] <JimE_zOS> I used the EDIT command to modify the LNI numbers and correct the sequencing pattern of the US Rule documents. Since we cannot edit the LNIs using Urbana, this was the workaround instructed by my SME.  Using Find command (example: F $00), I located each of the $00 per document and corrected the LNIs by overwriting the actual text. After that, I pressed F3 to save all changes.  
[07/24 14:10] <JimE_zOS> that just makes my skin crawl. 
[07/24 14:10] <02charlie> omg
[07/24 14:10] <02charlie> who is their sme?
[07/24 14:10] <02charlie> that's not they way to edit lnis
[07/24 14:11] <02charlie> the way
[07/24 14:11] <02charlie> i think thye need a new sme
[07/24 14:11] <JimE_zOS> STASK01057812, Charlie 
[07/24 14:11] <JimE_zOS> and I agree....none of this is even close to correct. 
[07/24 14:12] <JimE_zOS> the last thing we need is somebody clueless person dorking up LNIs 
[07/24 14:12] <JimE_zOS> I've already talked to FabSup.  They are going to look for a data area expert. 
[07/24 14:12] <06Amit_zOS> gosh
[07/24 14:13] <02charlie> well, i'm not surprised at where the request is coming from
[07/24 14:13] <JimE_zOS> Small island nation in the middle of the Pacific? 
[07/24 14:14] <02charlie> i would say more on the western side of the pacific, but yes :)
[07/24 14:15] <02charlie> im amazed SNow is displaying the image in the ticket itself
[07/24 14:16] <JimE_zOS> glad it did....the "browse substituted" was an important clue. 
[07/24 14:17] <02charlie> oh, i see what theyre doing. they're trying to edit the batch file that is input to the update
[07/24 14:18] <02charlie> still not the appropriate method, imho
[07/24 14:18] <JimE_zOS> yeah....by manually changing LNIs!! 
[07/24 14:19] <02charlie> so they're not the *exact* same people dealing with my ticket
[07/24 14:19] <JimE_zOS> but they all talk and share.  So wouldn't surprise me to know this is the common method of fixing LNIs 
[07/24 14:23] <02charlie> yeah. i would think doing those manual changes might have unintended side effects
[07/24 14:23] <JimE_zOS> how could they not. 
[07/24 14:23] <02charlie> btw, this t/o note confuses me: Per master ticket, fix has been identified and will be implemented during July Major Release
[07/24 14:24] <02charlie> hasnt the july major been done already?
[07/24 14:24] <JimE_zOS> it has, yet. 
[07/24 14:24] <JimE_zOS> yes, even. 
[07/24 14:24] <JimE_zOS> it kept me awake until almost 4am on Thursday night/Friday morning. 
[07/24 14:25] <02charlie> so dean's t/o note is making no sense to me
[07/24 14:25] <JimE_zOS> you could have stopped after "dean". 
[07/24 14:25] <02charlie> lol
[07/24 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> hahah
[07/24 14:26] <JimE_zOS> for my benefit, what is the correct tool to edit LNIs, Charlie? 
[07/24 14:29] <02charlie> i'd have to dig back into that. I thought the documents went thru an LNI stamper process.
[07/24 14:33] <JimE_zOS> no need to look. 
[07/24 14:34] <JimE_zOS> that really ought to be the SME's problem. 
[07/24 14:37] <dsk_hbe> sounds like he's not much of an 'E' ;-)
[07/24 14:37] <triveni> lol
[07/24 14:40] <02charlie> lol
[07/24 14:43] <02charlie> hmm, URPU20 converts a binary LNI (12 bytes) into a character LNI (28 characters)
[07/24 14:55] <triveni>  can i access the tool urbana
[07/24 14:55] <triveni> how to find it. 
[07/24 14:55] <triveni> under which options
[07/24 14:55] <02charlie> i think urbana is a unix-based tool
[07/24 14:56] <triveni> ohh
[07/24 14:56] <triveni> for reading mvs dataset i thought v r using urbna
[07/24 14:56] <triveni> urbana**
[07/24 14:57] <dsk_hbe> not something I ever have touched
[07/24 15:05] <02charlie> it used to be all the documents were stored in the MVS serial files once they were uploaded. That process got way more complex as time went on, and I'm not sure they're all still stored there, although they need to be in a serial file for our system to retrieve them. 
[07/24 15:05] <triveni> ok charlie
[07/24 15:07] <02charlie> my understanding was urbana was a unix based tool used to edit documents. Where they got those docs (possibly from the serial file) was fairly irrelevant to how they got edited. The result would end up as a batch file for input to the update process. However, since i have never used urbana, i am not certain about that
[07/24 15:08] <dsk_hbe> bottom line to your question, Triveni, it's not something we'd ever use on this team
[07/24 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[07/24 15:10] <06Amit_zOS> today's highest scorer-ZC84DK, dilligence.. nothing bad other than the heavy searches today..
[07/24 15:11] <triveni> ok debbie.. thanks
[07/24 15:13] <dsk_hbe> I've got a TON of old paper doc on Urbana from back when our team at the time (named OLM&R back then) was merged with DBM&R... they tried to teach us this stuff but it wasn't long before someone realized the two groups were best left separate.  Just too much for one person to support at the same time.  This doc dates back to 1994... I'm not even going to open it ;-) 
[07/24 15:13] <dsk_hbe> were you even born then??? ;-)
[07/24 15:13] <triveni> hahhaa ;)
[07/24 15:14] <triveni> I think amit wasn't born 
[07/24 15:14] <dsk_hbe> oh some says 1992... might be closer to your birth year ;-)
[07/24 15:14] <triveni> hahhaa
[07/24 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> fwiw, i was 1 year old
[07/24 15:15] <triveni> hahhaa
[07/24 15:15] <dsk_hbe> my son was too :-)
[07/24 15:16] <triveni> m from the 80's
[07/24 15:16] <triveni> i m older than amit atleast ;)
[07/24 15:16] <dsk_hbe> older and wiser, no doubt! ;-)
[07/24 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> she means wiser
[07/24 15:16] <triveni> hahaha
[07/24 15:17] <dsk_hbe> hey Amit, what are you counting for that high scorer?
[07/24 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> highest art across clusters
[07/24 15:18] <dsk_hbe> ah ok... I've not seen that ID before.  Might be interesting to see if he is a new trouble-maker in stats tomorrow
[07/24 15:18] <06Amit_zOS> he shows up occasionally in your reports
[07/24 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> not there in last nights runs
[07/24 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> its there in your older reports
[07/24 15:19] <dsk_hbe> well, instead of 'seen' Ishodul have said 'seen as a suspect'... I don' look much below the top counts in my reports.
[07/24 15:19] <06Amit_zOS> yes..
[07/24 15:20] <triveni> major crime suspect
[07/24 15:20] <dsk_hbe> exactly
[07/24 15:20] <06Amit_zOS> last week, there was a similar guy, i forgot to follow up if he was there next day in your reports.. sec
[07/24 15:20] <triveni> yeah m watching too much criminal mystery dese days.. i hv to lessen down.. ;)
[07/24 15:21] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/24 15:24] <06Amit_zOS> na.. not popular enough
[07/24 15:24] <06Amit_zOS> (i mean the other guy from last week)
[07/24 15:25] <dsk_hbe> I don't put a lot of stock into researching IDs on those messages unless they stand out.  Liek on Friday, this ID was new to me from my report of totals of those DARTs (including second in list for comparison):
[07/24 15:25] <dsk_hbe> Z37C44        0001105
[07/24 15:25] <dsk_hbe> PQNNB1        0000319
[07/24 15:26] <dsk_hbe> if you are interested, I haven't looked at thsi guy yet and need to leave soon.  It's a University of Texas ID so may have been doing their own year end stuff... but you are welcome to poke at him if you like.
[07/24 15:27] <06Amit_zOS> Sure
[07/24 15:27] <06Amit_zOS> thanks
[07/24 15:27] <dsk_hbe> In general though, we need to keep in mind that these are wall times reported on this diary stats, so it could just be that he was victim to other pigs slowing him down... especially if they are legitimately set as academics... years ago it was standard to give them low priority.  I miss those years ;-)
[07/24 15:28] <06Amit_zOS> hmm
[07/24 15:29] <dsk_hbe> the count is unusual though, so there may be more to that number
[07/24 15:30] <06Amit_zOS> was that the browse stats that you pasted debbie?
[07/24 15:30] <dsk_hbe> no, the DART counts by ID from the diary
[07/24 15:30] <dsk_hbe> so search stats
[07/24 15:30] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[07/24 15:33] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I have subbed UKAMBDS3 for that ID for Friday... this is a look at their SORs.  It will take a bit to run and, when complete, the job will route back to sysw.  I sub it with modifcications to gg.cellsord on rosW (job stolen from Bob Cella years ago... search guru that left us a few years back.)  You won't like easytrieve, but feel free to look at it if you are interested.
[07/24 15:33] <dsk_hbe> We can talk abotu the output more tomorrow if you like
[07/24 15:34] <JimE_zOS> so Dean is blindly pasting some goop into tickets?  How nice. 
[07/24 15:34] <dsk_hbe> cookbook problem solving... 
[07/24 15:34] <dsk_hbe> that only works if it's a Betty Crocker recipe ;-)
[07/24 15:34] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[07/24 15:35] <JimE_zOS> Manila people are now calling my cell phone, wanting to send me screen grabs of things so I can build accounts for them. 
[07/24 15:35] <triveni> I googled her
[07/24 15:35] <dsk_hbe> Betty?  you didn't know Betty??? ;-)
[07/24 15:35] <dsk_hbe> oh so fun for you, Jim :-(
[07/24 15:35] <JimE_zOS> Julia Child? 
[07/24 15:35] <JimE_zOS> kids. 
[07/24 15:36] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[07/24 15:36] <triveni> now I know
[07/24 15:36] <triveni> heehehe
[07/24 15:36] <triveni> they started in 1921
[07/24 15:37] <triveni> and got v popular between 1949 and 1964
[07/24 15:37] <triveni> Betty Crokcer its a brand
[07/24 15:38] <06Amit_zOS> i will take triveni's word for it
[07/24 15:38] <triveni> hahhaa

[07/25 11:24] <02charlie> debbie, you're not on the dr call, are you?
[07/25 11:25] <dsk_hbe> heck no
[07/25 11:25] <02charlie> they will have a pulse secure connection for the dr test, separate from the normal ones
[07/25 11:25] <dsk_hbe> my goal in life is never to attend one of those
[07/25 11:25] <02charlie> lol
[07/25 11:25] <02charlie> succeeding so far :)
[07/25 11:25] <dsk_hbe> I rely on you to tell me what I need, so thank you ;-)
[07/25 11:25] <02charlie> oh, and they want the on site participants and team contacts to be updated
[07/25 11:25] <dsk_hbe> I was wondering about that with the spfld connect 'gone'... but figured I'd find out the day before test time ;-)
[07/25 11:26] <02charlie> well, they still dont know, but they're working on it
[07/25 11:26] <dsk_hbe> you're our fearless leader now that Gail is gone... I'm counting on you ;-)
[07/25 11:26] <02charlie> i can see the dr test failing because they dont have a vpn connection into dr :)

[07/25 11:26] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/25 11:26] <02charlie> lol, i think that's going a bit far
[07/25 11:27] <dsk_hbe> that's one of many things that have changed that might make us slip but good!
[07/25 11:27] <dsk_hbe> well, you are the leader in my mind... and that is all that matters (to me ;-)
[07/25 11:33] <02charlie> lol
[07/25 11:35] <dsk_hbe> LOL, Jim... Doug is such a goof!
[07/25 11:46] <JimE_zOS> yeah....he also forwarded one of those Allstate "mayhem" commercials where the guy is mowing a lawn and "machine guns" this picture window with rocks. 
[07/25 11:47] <dsk_hbe> LOL!!!
[07/25 11:47] <JimE_zOS> needless to say, Mike really, really loves his car. 
[07/25 11:48] <dsk_hbe> it's a very cool car
[07/25 12:04] <06Amit_zOS> Debbie, this wsk user on your radar? CVBNXH
[07/25 12:05] <dsk_hbe> yeah, he's a browse pig
[07/25 12:06] <dsk_hbe> look at that third report in e88dsk20... he is always near the top... yesterday he browsed 5 times more docs than the next guy (also a pig ;-)
[07/25 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> yes i got him from there
[07/25 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> i did see him there near the top in the previous ones too!
[07/25 12:06] <dsk_hbe> those top 4 and frequently there
[07/25 12:08] <dsk_hbe> you're doing a great job familiarizing yourself with these stats, Amit... it makes me feel comfortable knowing you are looking, especially when I am on PTO
[07/25 12:10] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Debbie, its just fun looking at stats! 
[07/25 12:11] <dsk_hbe> AH!!!  A man after my own heart ;-)
[07/25 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> Guys, I was thinking if we could take the oncall weeks and weekends for thanksgiving and Christmas? Do you think we will be ready by then?
[07/25 12:55] <dsk_hbe> I vote yes!  but that is just a little selfish vote on my part ;-)  I do think you could be ready though, as long as you have one of us 3 as backups.  Either way, I appreciate you suggesting it Amit!  Lets see what Jim and Charlie say.
[07/25 12:56] <02charlie> yeah, as long as one of us is also oncall (as your oncall buddy) at the same time, i'd be ok with that
[07/25 12:57] <dsk_hbe> My vote is to take that a little further and call us their backup, not oncaller... I think that suggests just a little more freedom, for me at least.  We'll see what Jim thinks
[07/25 13:09] <06Amit_zOS> getting lunch.. brb
[07/25 13:09] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[07/25 13:22] <JimE_zOS> I'm fine with backup.  We just have to be careful not to let EK hear the word "backup" lest we end up in a permanent backup role again. 
[07/25 13:22] <JimE_zOS> instead of backup, how about we set-up a "phone a friend" role? 
[07/25 13:23] <JimE_zOS> same thing, of course, but I really don't want to use the word "backup" 
[07/25 13:23] <JimE_zOS> I fought a long time to do away with the backup role for SS. 
[07/25 13:27] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I'm good with any other wording.  I am just not a fan of calling it 'oncall'... to me that means I am stuck to my house so in the end it doesn't save me anything and I might as well just be the oncaller and give Amit holiday time.
[07/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> so how about this.  We'll assign a "life line buddy" while Amit and Triveni are oncall.  The buddy can change throughout the week, of course, as long as they have one. 
[07/25 13:30] <dsk_hbe> sounds good
[07/25 13:30] <02charlie> ok by me
[07/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> the buddy won't be in XM, so contact of the buddy will be strictly at the oncaller's choice
[07/25 13:31] <JimE_zOS> the buddy will be expected to respond via phone within 15 minutes (?) and be available by keyboard within 1 hour (?) 
[07/25 13:31] <JimE_zOS> is that too oncall like? 
[07/25 13:31] <dsk_hbe> sounds perfect
[07/25 13:32] <dsk_hbe> no, I feel we need to give Amit and Triveni some amount of expectation
[07/25 13:32] <JimE_zOS> right....don't want panic to set it. 
[07/25 13:32] <02charlie> this is all making sense, so i'm in agreement
[07/25 13:32] <dsk_hbe> at least I know that I can go shopping/out to dinner/something that I don't do now when oncall
[07/25 13:33] <JimE_zOS> and I'll further suggest that they take on no configuration changes during their probationary oncalls. 
[07/25 13:33] <dsk_hbe> good idea
[07/25 13:33] <triveni> yeah we should at least try the night time oncalls
[07/25 13:33] <02charlie> excellent
[07/25 13:33] <triveni> on our own
[07/25 13:33] <triveni> first
[07/25 13:34] <triveni> and we can call our friend roles, if something comes up
[07/25 13:34] <JimE_zOS> right....you would be oncall and expected to respond and work the issue to the best of your ability. 
[07/25 13:35] <JimE_zOS> if you get in trouble or need help, your life line buddy would be a page away. 
[07/25 13:35] <triveni> ok Jim.
[07/25 13:35] <JimE_zOS> if you don't need help, so much the better. 
[07/25 13:35] <triveni> yes
[07/25 13:40] <dsk_hbe> different topic... since I just got the reminder to do so, I thought I'd mention it here... I'm not sure what role Triveni and Amit will have for the October BCP/DR test, but fyi, if you haven't signed onto the 4 LSR clusters via TSO recently enough, your TSO profile datasets might not be available at BCP and you'd have to get a systems programmer to help you out.  To avoid this, I try to sign onto those clusters once a month.
[07/25 13:40] <dsk_hbe> Ever since they gave us the 'at' command for IOF, I dont' go to those boxes as frequently and this has bit me before.
[07/25 13:41] <triveni> ok Debbie..will do that
[07/25 13:51] <triveni> brb

[07/25 14:04] <triveni> back
[07/25 14:09] <06Amit_zOS> i dont remember having logging on to the other sr clusters.. I tried now, and im having pwd issues.. im trying the original pwd's Jim gave us but i know he changed the scheming of that a while ago
[07/25 14:09] <06Amit_zOS> now i believe its autogenerated..
[07/25 14:12] <dsk_hbe> sounds like you need to set a reminder like I do ;-)  Also, Ihave this job on roscoeC - mj.passwd, that I use to change MVS system passwords.  It includes a job for every system we might need to sign onto.  That way when I see the sysc password is about to expire, which likely means allt he rest are too, I can change them all at once.
[07/25 14:12] <06Amit_zOS> That's sooo handy Debbie!
[07/25 14:13] <dsk_hbe> you just edit the XXXXXXX to your current password and YYYYYYY to what you want to change it to.
[07/25 14:13] <dsk_hbe> a command like this will do a mass edit for you - EDIT /YYYYYYY/NEWPSWD/
[07/25 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> cool!
[07/25 14:15] <02charlie> yeah, mine is in ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(PASSWD)
[07/25 14:15] <02charlie> if you prefer TSO ;-D
[07/25 14:15] <06Amit_zOS> i am able to login to k,q and f
[07/25 14:15] <triveni> I am able to log in to all of the clusters
[07/25 14:15] <06Amit_zOS> I is mad at me
[07/25 14:15] <06Amit_zOS> I think I will need Jims help with that
[07/25 14:16] <triveni> I,L,K,B,Q,T,F,U and internal cluster
[07/25 14:16] <02charlie> and changing the passwords doesnt change the usage on the requisite tso and ispf datasets
[07/25 14:17] <dsk_hbe> just to be sure you know, Triveni... if you can log into I, you are good for L too... no need to sign into both... ditto for the other 3 clusters
[07/25 14:18] <triveni> yeah i noticed that
[07/25 14:18] <triveni> :)
[07/25 14:18] <dsk_hbe> good :-)
[07/25 14:22] <triveni> I have one more silly issue, i can't open zapmanager
[07/25 14:22] <triveni> Panel 'ZMPMAIN0' error  ,
[07/25 14:22] <triveni> Panel definition too large, greater than screen size.
[07/25 14:22] <triveni> this is the error i get, when i type tso zm
[07/25 14:23] <triveni> last to last week i guess, when Jim was showing us how to use it, i noticed this eror
[07/25 14:23] <02charlie> hmm
[07/25 14:23] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... I doubt this is it, but when you log into tso what do you have in this field before you enter your password?
[07/25 14:23] <dsk_hbe> Size      ===> 2096128
[07/25 14:24] <triveni>  Size      ===>,2096128,
[07/25 14:24] <triveni> yes 
[07/25 14:25] <triveni> Size      ===> 2096128
[07/25 14:25] <02charlie> ah
[07/25 14:25] <02charlie> you're probably using a 24x80 screen definition
[07/25 14:26] <02charlie> i think his panels use a different screen resolution
[07/25 14:26] <triveni>  I enjoy when charlie starts ssaying things like this.. I get to learn a lot
[07/25 14:26] <triveni> ;)
[07/25 14:27] <02charlie> and since i dont use hostexplorer, i dont know how to fix your issue
[07/25 14:27] <triveni> interesting
[07/25 14:27] <triveni> I am on my own tht means
[07/25 14:28] <06Amit_zOS> Not really... i believe Debbie uses host explorer as well
[07/25 14:34] <triveni> debbie should i send you my display settings 
[07/25 14:34] <dsk_hbe> sorry, someone at my door... yeah, I'll grab the info on host explorer settings I use, sec
[07/25 14:34] <triveni> ok
[07/25 14:35] <dsk_hbe> try using the 'model' of Model 5 (27x132)
[07/25 14:38] <dsk_hbe> sent you a properties paste to show you where it's set.
[07/25 14:38] <dsk_hbe> I think Amit and I talked abotu this once a while back but might have been when you weren't here.
[07/25 14:38] <triveni> ok debbie
[07/25 14:38] <triveni> lemme try
[07/25 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> is there supposed to be a zlfd release anytime ?
[07/25 14:39] <dsk_hbe> we just had one... wasn't that last week?
[07/25 14:40] <06Amit_zOS> so that means it IS part of the unix major releasE
[07/25 14:40] <dsk_hbe> or maybe 7/13... that's what I have written on my calendar
[07/25 14:41] <dsk_hbe> oh no, not at all, though there are certain things they do change that affect zlfd... for some reason the name of what they are escapes me... 
[07/25 14:41] <triveni> debbie my fields are not editable
[07/25 14:42] <dsk_hbe> sec
[07/25 14:42] <dsk_hbe> ok, I think you can't edit an active session... start fresh
[07/25 14:43] <triveni> ok
[07/25 14:44] <dsk_hbe> i.e., I start with an icon called 'Connection Central'.  if you do the same, I can help you... if you don't, I can't without seeing what you do.  I have my own profile setup so I don't have to alter things every time.  I call it 'My Profile'.  I can left click on that and choose properties and make the change there.
[07/25 14:45] <triveni> i can log in now
[07/25 14:45] <dsk_hbe> excellent
[07/25 14:45] <triveni> thanks debbie
[07/25 14:45] <triveni> :)
[07/25 14:45] <dsk_hbe> sure thing
[07/25 14:46] <06Amit_zOS>  ok, arent the jnorm and jsearch fault messages supposed to go away after the zlfd release?
[07/25 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> thats what i was getting at
[07/25 14:46] <dsk_hbe> which fault messages?
[07/25 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> lfd fault messages in diaries
[07/25 14:47] <dsk_hbe> which ones?

[07/25 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> although there used to be jdbutil faults that i dont see anymore
[07/25 14:48] <dsk_hbe> I don't think we expect those to ever go away.  What made you think that?
[07/25 14:50] <06Amit_zOS> oh, maybe its just mixing up memories, i thought someone said that they were few minor bugs that would go away after the next zlfd release 
[07/25 14:50] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... I don't know.  I wasn't here for the zlfd content meeting for that release.  Lemme see what Joe has in his spi
[07/25 14:50] <02charlie> i think we've seen SNNEWS abends go away
[07/25 14:53] <dsk_hbe> his SPI (143610) doesn't specifically say faults will go away but since he was fixing some negative news stuff I can see any related to that might dwindle.  But those that you pasted are fairly common
[07/25 14:54] <JimE_zOS> walking to 3pm meeting. 
[07/25 14:54] <JimE_zOS> back when I can. 
[07/25 14:54] <triveni> ok Jim

[07/25 14:59] <dsk_hbe> I guess he thought taking off the July wording woudl get you to not notice ;-)

[07/26 09:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Morning Debbie!
[07/26 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Debbie!
[07/26 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> Is the MFR limit change already done?
[07/26 09:36] <dsk_hbe> no, we won't do that until after the MVS release.
[07/26 09:37] <triveni> morning debbie.. gm Jim
[07/26 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah.. I see.. 
[07/26 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> so that change, does that mean that a search can service a few more DB's once thats done?
[07/26 09:40] <dsk_hbe> yeah.  If you have been watching zlfd errors, you can get an idea of how many.  jmenu puts out an error if we exceed the current max.  WE don't get a ton of those errors so there is no rush for this, but you can see which ones will be helped.
[07/26 09:41] <dsk_hbe> like this guy from yesterday - 20170725-23:46:26:304 2692279 966146454 SEVERE Error="ELEMENT_INPUT_ERROR" Severity="MAJ" Class="com.lxnx.ols.cmp.jmenu.JServMain" Method="doService" Message="Number of MFRs (10176) exceeds max (10000)" Event parameters : ErrorEvent : ELEMENT_INPUT_ERROR
[07/26 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Gotcha
[07/26 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks!
[07/26 09:43] <dsk_hbe> the best part if that the guy that got that particular error, got it 4 times... so he was a little relentless... the increase will likely make him only sub the search once
[07/26 09:43] <dsk_hbe> if=is

[07/26 10:14] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, I don't know if you noticed but in Jennifer Gumba's turnover this morning, she refers to a new LA_token incident - INC01595554... so Dean just needs to get onboard ;-)
[07/26 10:16] <02charlie> i hadnt yet gotten to jennifer's t/o note, thx!
[07/26 10:16] <dsk_hbe> I think I saw the same in a Manila turnover yesterday but didn't take the time to peek
[07/26 10:16] <02charlie> yea, mae made the comment in the new master
[07/26 10:17] <dsk_hbe> which I'm sure Dean will pay attention to %-)
[07/26 10:19] <02charlie> :)
[07/26 10:19] <02charlie> jennifer's is the first t/o note i have that mentions the new ticket, but mae put a comment in the (new) master ticket, it appears sometime around midnight 
[07/26 10:20] <02charlie> so i think someone in MW may have noticed my comment

[07/26 11:07] <charlie_away> hmm, lots of CREPPB+0001E abends in DW last night/this morning, which is usually a bad thing (especialy since a stylesheet update went in last night), but none today in either prod or dw, and all the abends happened right around 0145 when the copy would be shutting down and not around the time of the stylesheet update. because of these facts, i wont raise any alarm bells at the moment, but 
[07/26 11:07] <charlie_away> sharing FYI
[07/26 11:07] <charlie_away> i'm going to run out and meet someone for lunch about 1120

[07/26 12:17] <dsk_hbe> Triveni, those emails you just got about having access to some abuser docs in the ss_mvs share... these are docs we keep so Wayne can have a peek at where we stand because he doesn't have access to read the FCARD jobs.  We shoudl keep it up to date with each abuser change but I forget about it so we haven't.  Amit is going to bring the one called ABUSER up to date and then maybe from here we will remember with each change
[07/26 12:18] <triveni> ok Debbie.. thanks..
[07/26 12:18] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[07/26 12:23] <06Amit_zOS> ok, getting some lunch
[07/26 12:25] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, Wayne can read the batch F-Cards. 
[07/26 12:26] <dsk_hbe> yeah I shodul embellish that thsi doc also has some more info specific to who is who... company names etc.  so that helps him too
[07/26 12:27] <dsk_hbe> I think after he changed code to throttle everyone, his use of this has lessened... that abuser list used to be out of control  and this doc helped much more
[07/26 12:27] <JimE_zOS> PI00.PROD.METADATA.RECF(FDCOMN) 
[07/26 12:28] <dsk_hbe> he probably has a picture of the cards alone engrained in his brain now that its smaller ;-)
[07/26 12:29] <JimE_zOS> :-)
[07/26 12:29] <JimE_zOS> stepping away for some lunch. 
[07/26 12:32] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[07/26 12:35] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, do oyu mind if Amit makes an abuser card change tonight or tomorrow.. your choice.  We have a user hitting browse bulk processign pretty hard and Wayne woudl like to rein him in a little  
[07/26 12:36] <02charlie> tonight is fine
[07/26 12:36] <dsk_hbe> kthx, he's at lunch but I'm sure he'll see that
[07/26 12:36] <02charlie> i'm always for stopping browse abuse sooner rather than later
[07/26 12:45] <02charlie> jim, are we doing a team meeting today?
[07/26 12:45] <dsk_hbe> he's also at lunch
[07/26 12:45] <02charlie> doh! im not paying attention to much it looks like
[07/26 12:45] <02charlie> :)

[07/26 13:03] <JimE_zOS> back 
[07/26 13:04] <JimE_zOS> and I was leaning toward cancelling. 
[07/26 13:04] <JimE_zOS> unless, of course, others have things they want to cover. 
[07/26 13:04] <02charlie> i have an assignment to cover something, but i am definietly not ready. i can address it the next time, if we'll meet then
[07/26 13:08] <dsk_hbe> back
[07/26 13:08] <dsk_hbe> I'm good with cancelling
[07/26 13:08] <JimE_zOS> based on our rules (Debbie is in charge), I vote we cancel. 
[07/26 13:08] <JimE_zOS> Charlie can prep for next time 
[07/26 13:09] <JimE_zOS> and I'll trying and do something besides paperwork between now and then. 
[07/26 13:09] <dsk_hbe> now, now, now... I am not in charge and I refuse to serve... you're in charge whether you like it or not ;-)

[07/26 14:37] <dsk_hbe> thanks!
[07/26 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> a new fresh note should do right? do i need to give him the other discussion mails?

[07/26 14:43] <dsk_hbe> hehehe... always like the opportunities to call Don a troublemaker... he at least owns it ;-)
[07/26 14:43] <02charlie> lol
[07/26 14:45] <dsk_hbe> perfect email, Amit.  He didn't need to see me calling WSK load 'crap' ;-)
[07/26 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> Well, im not there yet..
[07/26 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> :-P
[07/26 14:47] <dsk_hbe> we are allowed to be snippy amongst ourselves... just got to be careful sharing that with manglers
[07/26 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> btw, i did end up using chkdig instead of ce.idrpt!
[07/26 14:48] <dsk_hbe> it is handy, isn't it?  oh but I was going to show you something about idrpt...s ec
[07/26 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> it is!
[07/26 14:50] <dsk_hbe> this version of it, which runs idinfo2, allows you to include multipel IDs at once... one stop shopping for a long list - MJ.IDINFO
[07/26 14:50] <dsk_hbe> you just plop the list of IDs down where I currently have two listed
[07/26 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> i stumbled onto idrpt while searching for the chkdig command ! Jim was with us at the time, i was naive enough to try and use the owner script with a user id ! lol.. Jim then told us about the idrpt
[07/26 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> thats even better Debbie!
[07/26 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> i can shave off a few seconds that way!
[07/26 14:52] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I wish I had thought of it earlier... sorry abotu that!

[07/27 09:43] <dsk_hbe> way to split the email thread, Charlie ;-)
[07/27 09:43] <02charlie> lol
[07/27 09:44] <02charlie> i was almost ready to hit send when yours arrived :D
[07/27 09:44] <dsk_hbe> it's fine... in this case I think G just needs to know to calm down... so a double slap is good ;-)

[07/27 10:17] <02charlie> i should pay moreattentio
[07/27 10:18] <dsk_hbe> The fact of the matter is... if the user is being impatient for their request to complete and just subbing more, throwing memory at it seems like a waste to me.
[07/27 10:19] <dsk_hbe> if he thinks we can solve edgar doc issues that have been with us simply forever, well, nope...

[07/27 10:19] <triveni> back
[07/27 10:28] <triveni> i was going through the lcre memory mail
[07/27 10:28] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[07/27 10:28] <triveni> hey Jim
[07/27 10:28] <02charlie> hi jim
[07/27 10:28] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Jim!
[07/27 10:28] <triveni> I wanted to know about splitting the document
[07/27 10:28] <triveni> how is that done, and then how the search happens.
[07/27 10:30] <triveni> in the mail, it says we don't split docs anymore.
[07/27 10:30] <triveni> I was just curious, how was that done earlier.
[07/27 10:34] <02charlie> can't really tell you how, but go to fabc ldc, click "get a document" and put this cite into the box: 42 USC 1983
[07/27 10:34] <02charlie> you'll find that doc has been split into 13 documents
[07/27 10:34] <02charlie> "THE CASE NOTES SEGMENT OF THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO 13 DOCUMENTS"
[07/27 10:35] <triveni> ok charlie
[07/27 10:36] <JimE_zOS> BTW, didn't really plan to stay home today. 
[07/27 10:37] <triveni> charlie, so they are tagged to one lni
[07/27 10:38] <02charlie> well, the parts of the LNI that are normally 00000-00 were meant to represent parts of the split doc. I haven't looked to see if thay actually did that with that doc
[07/27 10:39] <triveni> ok..
[07/27 10:46] <02charlie> btw, the books i was looking for two years ago when i sarted (like unix in a nutshell) finally turned back up
[07/27 10:47] <triveni> i hv heard the book name
[07/27 10:47] <triveni> never read it though ;)
[07/27 10:47] <triveni> is it good charlie
[07/27 10:47] <02charlie> good reference
[07/27 10:48] <02charlie> also my K&R C book. all a bit damp, but salvagable
[07/27 10:50] <JimE_zOS> is it safe to read "Unix in a Nutshell" if you have a peanut alergy? :-)
[07/27 10:50] <02charlie> if you're using a walnut shell, yes :D
[07/27 10:51] <dsk_hbe> ;-)

[07/27 11:31] <dsk_hbe> my kitties are so weird... they fight like they are going to kill each other (no claws out though so I guess it's 'play'... and then later I look at them and they are all cuddled up like they love each other.
[07/27 11:32] <triveni> aww..dats cute
[07/27 11:32] <dsk_hbe> back to killing each other... now licking their wounds ;-)
[07/27 11:33] <triveni> Debbie.. i was just talking to gordon.. he explained me that cool report in detail.. and also about yesterday's spike..
[07/27 11:33] <dsk_hbe> its a very cool report... we sure miss Kevin
[07/27 11:33] <triveni> :)
[07/27 11:34] <triveni> I want to be dere for the mvs release this weekend.
[07/27 11:34] <triveni> tell me what time u r planning to start
[07/27 11:34] <dsk_hbe> Charlie is doing this one
[07/27 11:34] <02charlie> stepping away from the kb for a bit
[07/27 11:35] <02charlie> i'll probably come online about 1am, but the action will start about 2am
[07/27 11:35] <triveni> ok charlie..
[07/27 11:37] <triveni> I forgot what we did last time in mvs release.. I ll brush up my memories this time..

[07/27 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Charlie, we did have this today:
[07/27 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> 042955 2406 AB-IBPC4HW,0001,69,IJCAHKCO,1555,0514,01,,,,,,SNNNEW+00010T##

[07/27 12:45] <02charlie> not unusual
[07/27 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> I thought you said snnnew won't be there after the zlfd release that just went in
[07/27 12:47] <06Amit_zOS> or maybe im just confused
[07/27 12:47] <06Amit_zOS> but if its not unusual, im happy
[07/27 12:48] <02charlie> no, i was asking vickie if the mvs release will make them go away
[07/27 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> Ah.. yes! 
[07/27 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> remembered
[07/27 12:50] <dsk_hbe> my watch is telling me that I have sat here for 3 hours without moving an inch... gonna take a quick trek around the downstairs ;-)  brb
[07/27 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> Oh so you too have one of those!!!!
[07/27 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie, you don't have it on do you?
[07/27 12:51] <06Amit_zOS> the fitbit's
[07/27 12:52] <02charlie> no, but there are health apps on my android and the iphone
[07/27 12:53] <dsk_hbe> back.  Mine is an Apple watch... surely Triveni has one of those??? ;-)
[07/27 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. you'd think! but i don't think she wears a watch at all!
[07/27 12:54] <dsk_hbe> man, I'm disappointed... thought she was the gadget queen!
[07/27 13:04] <dsk_hbe> what is OSRUS?
[07/27 13:04] <02charlie> im assuming the cts stuff
[07/27 13:05] <02charlie> but that's a WAG :)
[07/27 13:05] <02charlie> amazon music has a sing off channel
[07/27 13:05] <02charlie> all vocal music, like pentatonix
[07/27 13:06] <02charlie> nice 
[07/27 13:08] <dsk_hbe> there's some CTS stuff there so I guess if it is CTS stuff, it's a subset.  I'll ask Anita just out of curiousity
[07/27 13:10] <JimE_zOS> backback 
[07/27 13:11] <dsk_hbe> where did you gogo?
[07/27 13:11] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/27 13:11] <02charlie> :)
[07/27 13:11] <02charlie> dancing? ;)
[07/27 13:12] <JimE_zOS> like Pentatonix.  Have a number of their Christmas albums.  Good workout music. 
[07/27 13:13] <02charlie> they just played one by Karmin called Acapella, sounds like that would be a good workout one too
[07/27 13:13] <06Amit_zOS> I would pay to see Jim dancing! :-D
[07/27 13:13] <02charlie> lol
[07/27 13:13] <02charlie> you might see that when his daughters get married :D
[07/27 13:14] <02charlie> but im guessing not before :)
[07/27 13:14] <02charlie> you wont see me doing that :D
[07/27 13:14] <02charlie> (dancing)
[07/27 13:14] <dsk_hbe> ICYC, Anita's reply:
[07/27 13:14] <dsk_hbe> They're the test team that is supposed to be writing test cases for our ZLFD, Online, Stylesheet & Update changes.
[07/27 13:14] <dsk_hbe> I don't remember what it means, maybe "O" = "online" ; "SR" = "search & retrieve"; "US" = "update systems"?
[07/27 13:14] <dsk_hbe> Anyhow, after years of them being outsources to Cognizant, and providing less value each year; the work got switched to Infosys earlier this year when Dave R. re-did the entire test organization.  To say we're having growing pains is an understatement.
[07/27 13:15] <02charlie> who needs test cases? dont we just test in prod anyway 8-O
[07/27 13:17] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[07/27 13:21] <JimE_zOS> to be clear, nobody is likely to see me dance.  Period. 
[07/27 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> What if you had to dance to save life's? or better yet, get FULL access, without restrictionc to anything and everything related to OPC!??????
[07/27 13:23] <dsk_hbe> since he doesn't drink, I'd expect that woudl be a good bet that nothing can coax it out of him.
[07/27 13:24] <JimE_zOS> I've managed to worm my way into everything I've ever wanted RE: OPC. 
[07/27 13:24] <JimE_zOS> so I don't need to sell my soul for that. 
[07/27 13:24] <02charlie> lol
[07/27 13:24] <JimE_zOS> to save a non-manager's life?  Yeah, maybe. 
[07/27 13:24] <02charlie> lol
[07/27 13:24] <06Amit_zOS> No, you did once talk about something with the opc that still evaded you..
[07/27 13:24] <02charlie> im grateful for that
[07/27 13:25] <JimE_zOS> I do try to help people with charitable contributions and blood donations. 
[07/27 13:25] <02charlie> but my guess is that if there is a father-daughter dance at your daughters' weddings, that might be the only opportunity to see the event :)
[07/27 13:25] <06Amit_zOS> :-D
[07/27 13:26] <JimE_zOS> still seems unlikely 
[07/27 13:26] <06Amit_zOS> Yes Jim, i agree, your blood will be much more usefull to save lives than some of your dance routines.
[07/27 13:26] <02charlie> yeah, but i'm guessing p > 0.00 :D
[07/27 13:43] <triveni> b
[07/27 13:43] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie, what are they doing when they get CREXDD in DW?
[07/27 13:43] <06Amit_zOS> we had 3 of them today
[07/27 13:44] <06Amit_zOS>  033246 M241 CREXDD/104W: Inv. Attr: 6691/5060/00109324 csi'
[07/27 13:44] <06Amit_zOS> making changes to the csi?
[07/27 13:45] <02charlie> they're doing a  retrieval, which wont work because the document is defective, so no matter how they do the retrieval (and from DW they had S.TEMPDEL="Y" in the prodinfo string, which allows them to retrieve the document even if it is temp-deleted), it will fail trying to parse the doc
[07/27 13:47] <02charlie> as i wrote in their ticket today:
[07/27 13:48] <02charlie> I don't think you're going to be able to use your data warehouse-based tools to retrieve the document, as there were three more such failures yesterday in data warehouse. You will need to deser the document and then edit that copy of the document.
[07/27 13:50] <06Amit_zOS> oh so they were trying to retrieve the document for which i had raised the ticket way back exactly a month ago
[07/27 13:50] <06Amit_zOS> INC01572760
[07/27 13:50] <06Amit_zOS> ?
[07/27 13:50] <02charlie> yes
[07/27 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> ah.. couldnt figure that out from the lcre diary for dw
[07/27 13:51] <02charlie> it's the only open ticket for that doc, they resolved the last one while i was out
[07/27 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[07/27 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> thank you! :)
[07/27 13:52] <02charlie> thank you!
[07/27 14:07] <02charlie> he paid no attention to my private comment yesterday, so now it's in cos for everyone to see

[07/28 09:53] <dsk_hbe> HI Triveni.  I forgot to ask you if you were feeling better?
[07/28 09:54] <triveni> m good debbie..
[07/28 09:54] <triveni> :)
[07/28 09:54] <dsk_hbe> good!
[07/28 09:58] <triveni> brb
[07/28 10:04] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[07/28 10:07] <02charlie> back
[07/28 10:08] <02charlie> debbie got a question
[07/28 10:08] <dsk_hbe> yes?
[07/28 10:09] <02charlie> so yesterday i did the fake hirls up to the point where i waited on the dev's approval
[07/28 10:09] <02charlie> so can I just re-log in to the box and pick up where i left off (i think so, but i thought i'd ask first)
[07/28 10:10] <dsk_hbe> I didn't have lcre for the last release and it's been forever sicne I did one before that... let me go look at the doc and give it some thought, sec.
[07/28 10:10] <02charlie> sure
[07/28 10:10] <02charlie> it's been a year since i did my last one too
[07/28 10:10] <02charlie> but you've done more than me
[07/28 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> once thats done, can someone tell me what's a fake hirl!?
[07/28 10:12] <dsk_hbe> the how-to doc doesn't really say but I'd have to guess that you are correct as well.  I am pretty sure that event he ones I did they replied before my session timed out (the doc says that's 2 hours)
[07/28 10:13] <02charlie> yeah, mine too, but they had the package prepped so late, and i usually wait till i get the package to do the fake
[07/28 10:14] <dsk_hbe> if you aren't comfortable with that answer, maybe ask Brian McKee... they do way more fakes than we do.
[07/28 10:14] <02charlie> oh, good point
[07/28 10:15] * triveni has joined #theRock
[07/28 10:15] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[07/28 10:15] <triveni> b
[07/28 10:15] <dsk_hbe> Amit, this is one place where I have to say we were given a cookbook and we use it... I don't know much about this beyond that cookbook.  Used to be that we didn't even do our own fakes so it's not something we have done a lot of... so few releases and not having done them until recent years
[07/28 10:15] <dsk_hbe> Jim may understand the innards of it way more than I do, certainly.
[07/28 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> Ok..
[07/28 10:17] <dsk_hbe> my basic thinking is they are just settign up a way to prep the unix-y pieces of the release, but they gave the process silly names that make you think there is more to it ;-)  fake; hirl... ok, whatever ;-)
[07/28 10:17] <dsk_hbe> so I think all this really does is pull the code base from cert world and create a prep copy in the prod world
[07/28 10:18] <02charlie> my understanding is that the hirl is the process of getting software installed on the unix boxes, and the fake hirl goes thru the motions, but doesnt actually install it, to verify the hirl will work when it's time
[07/28 10:18] <02charlie> and what debbie said :)
[07/28 10:18] <02charlie> (Rule 1)
[07/28 10:18] <02charlie> :D
[07/28 10:18] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[07/28 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> cool.. one more question though.. why is this part of the MVS RELEASE!???
[07/28 10:19] <02charlie> because we need to install the LCRE stuff too
[07/28 10:20] <dsk_hbe> we pretty much demanded that we own the OLS code and LCRE really is OLS code just packaged into the a Linux platform
[07/28 10:20] <02charlie> there's actually a separate release and change number for that part
[07/28 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[07/28 10:21] <dsk_hbe> like Charlie said, it has to go at the same time as the OLS so to avoid relying on RD to tag team, this is best
[07/28 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. will try to be online to see how different this is going to be
[07/28 10:23] <dsk_hbe> I used to think why not let RD install this too... but several years back they hosed the package they sent and I had a heck of a time getting ahold of one of them to come back to work Friday afternoon to fix it... ever snce that I am so very on board with this checks and balances we now have.
[07/28 10:24] <02charlie> its doing the backups now
[07/28 10:45] <02charlie> btw, brian said
[07/28 10:45] <02charlie> [07/28 10:43] <RD_Brian> We typically run the backup at the same time we run the fake... we don't wait until the fake is approved, but you can do that at any time, really... I suppose the advantage of waiting is that if there's something wrong with the fake and you need to run it again, you don't also need to run the backup again.  Did that answer your question?
[07/28 10:45] <02charlie> [07/28 10:44] <RD_Brian> But yes, you can just do the op rungo again and select the backup option.
[07/28 10:46] <dsk_hbe> cool
[07/28 10:51] <02charlie> ok, now i'm waiting on saturday afternoon
[07/28 12:09] <06Amit_ZOS> What friday plans guys!?? 
[07/28 12:12] <dsk_hbe> my Fridays are usually boring... pizza for dinner and that's abotu it... typical 60-year old boredom ;-)
[07/28 12:12] <06Amit_ZOS> Thats not bad! you don't have to cook right!? Just kick back and relax!
[07/28 12:14] <06Amit_ZOS> go crazy on the topings maybe.. jalepenos peppers and olives with extra cheese ! \m/!
[07/28 12:14] <06Amit_ZOS> for charlie, instead of cheese, its extra salt!
[07/28 12:14] <02charlie> :D
[07/28 12:15] <06Amit_ZOS> :-)
[07/28 12:15] <dsk_hbe> I am limited by my husband's desire to never eat vegetables... even goign halfies some creep onto his side ;-)  But yeah, I venture formt he norm myself sometimes :-)
[07/28 12:17] <06Amit_ZOS> Sun's shining through the clouds right now over here! It'd be fun to be outside! I will finally get to work on my thesis a bit this weekend
[07/28 12:17] <dsk_hbe> I woudl have thought you couldn't graduate without that, no?
[07/28 12:18] <06Amit_ZOS> I meant, converting my thesis into a paper. Yes, i already am done with the thesis part.. 
[07/28 12:18] <dsk_hbe> ah cool!
[07/28 12:18] <06Amit_ZOS> hopefully will send it to elsevier to publish it!
[07/28 12:19] <dsk_hbe> nice!
[07/28 12:19] <06Amit_ZOS> do you guys know any inside connections so that they will accept my paper?!

[07/28 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> you said you were waiting for it
[07/28 14:26] <charlie_away> look at the install template https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/ssmvs/MVS%20Releases/Forms/Sandifer.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fssmvs%2fMVS%20Releases%2fReleases%202017%2f07%20%28Jul%29%2030&FolderCTID=0x012000D679C8E6F2952E4991228677940C6C1C&View=%7b35B2571C%2dFD7D%2d4EF0%2d868A%2d1E599206C015%7d
[07/28 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> Got it
[07/28 14:30] <06Amit_zOS> thnx
[07/28 14:30] <dsk_hbe> speaking of that doc, Charlie, I don;t think I got a reply about the changes you made.  I couldn't tell what you were referring to.
[07/28 14:30] <charlie_away> oh
[07/28 14:31] <charlie_away> well, let me do a redline with an old version
[07/28 14:31] <dsk_hbe> tha would help, thanks
[07/28 14:31] <charlie_away> btw, where do we keep our common docs
[07/28 14:31] <charlie_away> ?
[07/28 14:32] <dsk_hbe> under MVS Releases there is a 'Release Dcoumentation' folder.  Those are supposed to be common docs
[07/28 14:32] <charlie_away> ah
[07/28 14:32] <dsk_hbe> theya re supposed to be what we use with each release.
[07/28 14:32] <charlie_away> i knew it was somewhere
[07/28 14:33] <dsk_hbe> there is a sub folder for old versions that any changed versions shoudl go into
[07/28 14:33] <dsk_hbe> by changed I mean previous versions.
[07/28 14:33] <dsk_hbe> there are likely a ton of the install template out thre since we change it so often as processes change
[07/28 14:34] <06Amit_zOS> anywhoo, the release template is very helpfull and descreptive enought for us to understand
[07/28 14:34] <06Amit_zOS> Me likey!
[07/28 14:35] <dsk_hbe> yes and in many places it refers to other doc that is more detailed... you'll find those in that same 'Release Documentation' folder
[07/28 14:36] <charlie_away> the fke hirl and hirl docs are there too
[07/28 14:36] <charlie_away> fake
[07/28 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[07/28 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[07/28 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> I guess even i will leave now and connect on saturday

[07/30 00:18] <02charlie> good morning :)
[07/30 00:19] <06Amit_ZOS> :-)
[07/30 00:45] * triveni_away is now known as triveni
[07/30 00:45] <triveni> Hello Charlie
[07/30 00:46] <02charlie> hi triveni
[07/30 00:47] <triveni> Please tell me if anything that needs to be checked or to be prepared.
[07/30 00:47] <triveni> will follow your lead
[07/30 00:52] <02charlie> i would pull up a copy of the install template and have it handy
[07/30 00:52] <02charlie> amit, you did the last install with debbie or jim, correct?
[07/30 00:53] <06Amit_ZOS> with Debbie
[07/30 00:53] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/30 00:54] <triveni> ok charlie
[07/30 01:05] <06Amit_ZOS> I miss my config chart!
[07/30 01:05] <06Amit_ZOS> to look into sysplex for bridges
[07/30 01:05] <triveni> oh yeah dat ll b required
[07/30 01:06] <triveni> it would hv helped
[07/30 01:11] <02charlie> i'm doing step 3 on page 6 now
[07/30 01:12] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[07/30 01:13] <triveni> ok charlie
[07/30 01:17] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Charlie, not all critical renames are there in the current plan is it?
[07/30 01:17] <06Amit_ZOS> i searched for se00crn* and there was only 1
[07/30 01:18] <02charlie> just SE00CRNLXET10
[07/30 01:18] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[07/30 01:18] <02charlie> the only other one that would be scheduled on a sunday morning might be an f-card one
[07/30 01:19] <02charlie> and we dont do those on releases
[07/30 01:19] <02charlie> (usually)
[07/30 01:19] <06Amit_ZOS> and the f-card one is automatically picked up because of the stuff you did in the afternoon
[07/30 01:20] <02charlie> basically that one takes the current f-card version and changes the automatic settings to manual
[07/30 01:20] <06Amit_ZOS> i didnt realize that the other renames are not done on realease nights.. but it makes sense because i heard that we are usually static metadata-wise on release nights
[07/30 01:22] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway, i hope the sysplex for the lsr's and the lfd's look good
[07/30 01:25] <triveni> amit can u see that sysplex status
[07/30 01:25] <triveni> hv u tried that
[07/30 01:25] <02charlie> yes, if you run the console commands you can find at step 3 on page 6, you will see thatnone of the bridge FDs (81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88) and none of the bridge SRs are using the CF (only SRs *2, *3, *7, *8)
[07/30 01:26] <triveni> ok
[07/30 01:26] <02charlie> SRs *2, *3, *7, *8 are not bridge SRs
[07/30 01:30] <triveni> m typing this D xcf,str,strname=LSRREQPRODCL01* 
[07/30 01:30] <triveni> in tsoc
[07/30 01:30] <02charlie> you need to get to the console first
[07/30 01:31] <triveni> option 6
[07/30 01:31] <02charlie> that's the TSO console, you need to get to the operator console
[07/30 01:31] <02charlie> there are several ways, easiest is to go thru iof
[07/30 01:31] <triveni> ok
[07/30 01:31] <02charlie> when in iof, your # as the primary command
[07/30 01:32] <02charlie> sheesh
[07/30 01:32] <02charlie> when in iof, typeas the primary command
[07/30 01:32] <02charlie> sheesh
[07/30 01:32] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[07/30 01:32] <02charlie> when in iof, type # as the primary command
[07/30 01:32] <triveni> ok
[07/30 01:32] <02charlie> i had overtype on
[07/30 01:33] <02charlie> # will get you to the operator console
[07/30 01:33] <triveni> yeah 
[07/30 01:33] <triveni> i could see that
[07/30 01:33] <triveni> Command response ===> CONSOLE        SYSLOG/CONSOLE/NONE
[07/30 01:33] <triveni> MVS/JES2 command ===> D xcf,str,strname=LSRREQPRODCL01*
[07/30 01:33] <triveni> should i do this
[07/30 01:33] <02charlie> yep
[07/30 01:34] <triveni> perfect
[07/30 01:34] <triveni> thanks charlie
[07/30 01:41] <triveni> charlie i could see what u meant earlier now.
[07/30 01:41] <triveni> CF is not being used by the FDs and the bridge sr's
[07/30 01:41] <06Amit_ZOS> you would do the hirl immediately after doing the SE001ZREL$INSTAL isn't it?
[07/30 01:43] <02charlie> i usually do the hirl while they are checking the basic functionality of the SA/FDs: "The steps below can be done in parallel while development is checking out LSA/LSR in first round"
[07/30 01:44] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah..
[07/30 01:45] <triveni> amit what happens in this hirl 
[07/30 01:45] <triveni> what will we check 
[07/30 01:46] <02charlie> not much, since you're not doing the hirl
[07/30 01:46] <triveni> ok
[07/30 01:47] <06Amit_ZOS> the new release of lcre is 'hirl'ed into the unix side... 
[07/30 01:47] <06Amit_ZOS> so, we only will be checking diaries..
[07/30 01:47] <06Amit_ZOS> including the lcre diaries obviously
[07/30 01:49] <triveni> ok
[07/30 01:51] <triveni> lemme know wen to start checkin diaries
[07/30 01:51] <06Amit_ZOS> i know joe and wayne will be out, arent anita and vickie joining us?
[07/30 01:52] <02charlie> anita, vickie, and joe will still be here even tho he's on pto
[07/30 01:52] <02charlie> but they wont join until closer to 2
[07/30 02:09] <06Amit_ZOS> too early for diaries just yet..
[07/30 02:10] <06Amit_ZOS> nothing there yet
[07/30 02:10] <02charlie> correct
[07/30 02:10] <triveni> ok
[07/30 02:13] <02charlie> amit, you could run diaries now to check the vvmm of the new modules are there
[07/30 02:13] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[07/30 02:14] <triveni> what are we looking for in diaries
[07/30 02:14] <triveni> mostly ablines right?
[07/30 02:14] <02charlie> yes
[07/30 02:14] <triveni> ok
[07/30 02:15] <triveni> no ablines in cluster 1 to 4
[07/30 02:16] <02charlie> well, they'll check the diaries
[07/30 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> vesion mods of randomly picked modules are matching 
[07/30 02:16] <02charlie> run the diaries again triveni
[07/30 02:16] <06Amit_ZOS> so im guessing good
[07/30 02:16] <triveni> ok
[07/30 02:16] <02charlie> excellent
[07/30 02:17] <02charlie> oh you need t run for sa and fd too
[07/30 02:18] <triveni> ok
[07/30 02:19] <06Amit_ZOS> but no lfd's are up right?
[07/30 02:19] <triveni> sr looks good
[07/30 02:19] <02charlie> oh, right
[07/30 02:20] <triveni> yes

[07/30 02:22] <triveni> yeah
[07/30 02:24] <06Amit_ZOS> oh, so the lcre hirl does not turn it on again
[07/30 02:25] <02charlie> no, that just puts the software out there
[07/30 02:28] <02charlie> amit, if you'd like to do the lfd diaries to verify the vvmms
[07/30 02:28] <06Amit_ZOS> doing
[07/30 02:28] <06Amit_ZOS> doing only fd8 since only 80 is up
[07/30 02:30] <triveni> what should be the vermod
[07/30 02:30] <06Amit_ZOS> all good on fd
[07/30 02:30] <06Amit_ZOS> its in the package is prepped mail..
[07/30 02:32] <06Amit_ZOS> and lcre will be up only once you complete the EOD$LCRE  right (so that i can run the lcre diaries after you do that)
[07/30 02:33] <triveni> got it
[07/30 02:33] <02charlie> you can get lcre diraies now, the copies just came up
[07/30 02:33] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[07/30 02:37] <triveni> do v check vermods here as well
[07/30 02:37] <triveni> there r no ablines as such for lcre diaries
[07/30 02:38] <02charlie> too early to run lcre diaries except to check the vvmms
[07/30 02:38] <02charlie> until they say they are ready for diaries, we wont know
[07/30 02:40] <triveni> ok
[07/30 02:40] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, that was when i though hirl meant that the lcre's are up with the new pieces, that when it must have caused this:17/07/30 02.21 SE00LCRE$UNENMAX
[07/30 02:40] <06Amit_ZOS> i hope thats not an issue
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> i was trying to match                   Load module listing for:  LEXISSR from the mail
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> with the lcrediary run
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> version mods looks different to me
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> amit just crosscheck it once
[07/30 02:41] <02charlie> sr wont match lcre
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> yeah dats wat
[07/30 02:41] <triveni> so which vermod to check
[07/30 02:42] <06Amit_ZOS> for sr, run sr diaries and check vermods
[07/30 02:42] <06Amit_ZOS> i dont think lcre has vermods
[07/30 02:42] <triveni> sr done
[07/30 02:42] <triveni> fro lcre m trying to know
[07/30 02:43] <02charlie> i think you'd need to go to the spis themselves and get the info

[07/30 02:43] <triveni> in the prep file its given

[07/31 09:55] <dsk_hbe> how's come you are worried about those, Charlie?
[07/31 09:56] <02charlie> because that's what is preventing me from doing a dot command search in fabc
[07/31 09:56] <dsk_hbe> gotcha... just making sure there wasn't an external complaint I didn't see
[07/31 09:57] <dsk_hbe> I'd tell Jimc... which you kinda did already on #cos ;-)

[07/31 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway.. meeting

[07/31 10:02] <02charlie> oh, ww was for good morning to amit :)
[07/31 10:03] <dsk_hbe> hard to keep track of you ;-)
[07/31 10:34] <02charlie> vendor? so we're not building it ourselves?
[07/31 10:34] <02charlie> will we even own the code?
[07/31 10:35] <dsk_hbe> ask Ed ;-)  Isn't he the 360 expert?
[07/31 10:35] <02charlie> "volume seems to exacerbate the issues" sheesh

[07/31 11:23] <Amit_away> I have a question.. how do i pay for my dental visit today? you know in order to claim my dental insurance
[07/31 11:24] * Amit_ZOS has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 366 seconds)
[07/31 11:24] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/31 11:24] <02charlie> you give them your dental card info
[07/31 11:24] <02charlie> and if you have an HSA account you can pay for the co-pay with that
[07/31 11:26] <06Amit_zOS> ok, dental card- is same as the united health care card that they sent i assume?
[07/31 11:26] <06Amit_zOS> and how do i co-pay with HSA?
[07/31 11:27] <02charlie> no, i think the uhc card is for medical
[07/31 11:27] <02charlie> sec
[07/31 11:27] <06Amit_zOS> i don't know that they sent me a separate dental card
[07/31 11:27] <dsk_hbe> I'm not help ont he dental card part as I use my husband's insurance.  For HSA, do you have a HSA debit card?  If so, pay with that
[07/31 11:27] <06Amit_zOS> no, i don't have an HSA debit card
[07/31 11:28] <02charlie> dental for me is Aetna Dental-DPO 
[07/31 11:28] <dsk_hbe> well your HSA makes no sense to me then... I also have that with my husband's company so I can't help much more I guess, sorry!@
[07/31 11:29] <02charlie> yeah, i have a debit card with the HSA
[07/31 11:29] <06Amit_zOS> ok.. let me see what i can find out
[07/31 11:29] <dsk_hbe> well that's good... Iw as thinking LN's was through OptumBank like mine.  Good luck Amit!
[07/31 11:29] <02charlie> and i might be wrong, they might not have a card with the dental maybe you tell them its aenta dental ppo and they can look you up?
[07/31 11:29] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks anyway guys :)
[07/31 11:30] <02charlie> and the HSA debit card is indeed thru Optum Bank
[07/31 11:30] <dsk_hbe> our denatl is via MetLife and they never have a card... I guess that's somewhat common
[07/31 11:30] <06Amit_zOS> I will look into it
[07/31 11:30] <02charlie> if you go to the UHC website, you should be able to see what you hsa balances are
[07/31 11:31] <02charlie> btw, i've requested 8/3 and 8/4 for PTO
[07/31 11:31] <triveni> ok charlie
[07/31 11:32] <dsk_hbe> okie dokie, Charlie
[07/31 11:33] <triveni> brb
[07/31 11:33] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I'm going to request 8/31 and 9/1... Charlie beat me to those dates so I emailed Jim to see if he minded being left with just the 3 of you again.  Since I don't expect a reply while he shodul be vacationing I will go ahead and make the formal requests and can always change them later if it s a probelm for him.
[07/31 11:34] <02charlie> they're my annual CLE dates, i could alway take the laptop with me and be connected while there
[07/31 11:35] <dsk_hbe> I'm sure Jim will say all is fine and if not, I don't have to have them... just wanted the extra time with company visiting.  You shodul not take your laptop and pay attention to your training ;-)
[07/31 11:39] <02charlie> you obviously have never been to a meeting with 400+ lawyers in the same room :D
[07/31 11:40] <dsk_hbe> THANK GOD!!!! :-)
[07/31 11:40] <02charlie> lol
[07/31 11:40] <02charlie> indeed
[07/31 12:03] <triveni> b
[07/31 12:07] <dsk_hbe> every week about thsi time I find myself wishing I'd tracked work time better through the week instead of leaving it all for Monday... yet tomorrow I will quickly lose that drive once again %-}

[07/31 13:05] <triveni> so wen are v going to do it in prod
[07/31 13:06] <dsk_hbe> this weekend... I ahven't decided when yet.  We will do FABC first... then prod and DW (though it likely will never care) this weekend
[07/31 13:06] <triveni> ok debbie..count me in too..
[07/31 13:06] <triveni> tell us and will follow ur lead..
[07/31 13:07] <dsk_hbe> we also need to do C1, but I have a ntoe out to RD to do their part first (they own C1 zlfd)
[07/31 13:07] <triveni> ok
[07/31 13:08] <dsk_hbe> ok, but you might have to fight Amit for pieces since he already asked to do it.  There really isn't a lot to change, but I wanted to be sure you guys were ok with vi before we wandered into chasmtui land for that piece
[07/31 13:09] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[07/31 13:13] <triveni> ok debbie..

[07/31 13:21] <dsk_hbe> cool, thanks!  Now I know I do't have to worry about you guys hating vi too much ;-)
[07/31 13:21] <dsk_hbe> Dave Finney hated vi until the day he retired ;-)
[07/31 13:21] <triveni> hahaha
[07/31 13:21] <triveni> its just different
[07/31 13:21] <06Amit_zOS> i totally understand !

[07/31 13:22] <triveni> makes you a little bit cranky
[07/31 13:22] <triveni> but can be handled
[07/31 13:22] <triveni> ;)
[07/31 13:22] <dsk_hbe> this will be a fast change... just one line per OLS (prod, dw, fabc) so I think you won't hate it to much
[07/31 13:23] <dsk_hbe> to=too
[07/31 13:29] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[07/31 13:30] <02charlie> that took a lot longer than expected because the officer at the bank was someone who when to school with my sisters, so i got chatted up :)

[07/31 13:31] <dsk_hbe> what's the population of your town, Charlie? sounds like everyone knows everyone!
[07/31 13:32] <02charlie> you'd be amazed at how many connections there are in this small community
[07/31 13:33] <02charlie> and the office is normally at the main branch, not the one up the street from me, but the usual one is probably on vacation
[07/31 13:33] <06Amit_zOS> how many sisters do you have Charlie?
[07/31 13:33] <02charlie> three
[07/31 13:33] <02charlie> and between my sisters and my brothers, they probably know everyone in the county :)

[08/01 09:42] <triveni> hahhaa
[08/01 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Debbie, 8FHH7F is a familiar guy to you isn't he?
[08/01 10:08] <dsk_hbe> yes, it's the Diligence healthcheck ID... an automated ID that runs regularly to make sure we have bitmaps cached to save cycles for Diligence users.
[08/01 10:09] <dsk_hbe> If you see him top the FG CPU list in my job... that's a good thing.  He's my baramoter... if I see people above him I worry abotu them if they have a ton more cpu than he does
[08/01 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> oh.. so its an internal thing
[08/01 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[08/01 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks
[08/01 10:38] <dsk_hbe> if they ever make one awesome change to editting, it woudl have to be the ability to highlight a really long sentence that you accidentally typed in all caps, and be able to hit a button to switch it to non-cap ;-)
[08/01 10:43] <dsk_hbe> Amit or Triveni... I haven't heard back from Brian yet on making the MFR change to C1 zlfd, so I think what we shodul do is go ahead and make teh MVS change and then ship the ticket to RD.  Which of you woudl like to do that for me?
[08/01 10:44] <02charlie> you can do that basically in word
[08/01 10:44] <dsk_hbe> huh?
[08/01 10:44] <02charlie> change case
[08/01 10:45] <dsk_hbe> oh that'd be nice... unfortuately I was in a text doc... I'm glad Word is smart enough for that
[08/01 10:46] <02charlie> textpad and notepad++ both do that also. now if you were in notepad, you're sol
[08/01 10:47] <dsk_hbe> notepad it is... 
[08/01 10:47] <06Amit_ZOS> i can do it Debbie
[08/01 10:47] <02charlie> ugh
[08/01 10:47] <dsk_hbe> great!  need any more info than that or have you done a C1 fcard change before?
[08/01 10:47] <02charlie> i have gotten away fron notepad on all my devices
[08/01 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> i have done a c1 fcard change before
[08/01 10:48] <dsk_hbe> it's what comes with this machine and I don't change much abotu what I get with the machine for fear no one will support me
[08/01 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> no need of a change request on snow right?
[08/01 10:48] <dsk_hbe> excellent... thanks, Amit!
[08/01 10:48] <02charlie> i prefer notepad++, but on this machine i also use textpad, since it's a supported tool
[08/01 10:48] <dsk_hbe> correct, no snow
[08/01 10:51] <06Amit_ZOS> so i need to change the MFR limit for both the SA and FD in NZ00.SS.CONFIG.FCARDS.C1 right?
[08/01 10:51] <06Amit_ZOS> grom 10000 to 10500
[08/01 10:51] <06Amit_ZOS> *from
[08/01 10:51] <dsk_hbe> correct
[08/01 11:00] <triveni> can i do dataware house changes debbie
[08/01 11:00] <dsk_hbe> if you have fought Amit for them ;-)  But those are later this week.  We'll do them with prod
[08/01 11:01] <dsk_hbe> actually... let me remind myself of something
[08/01 11:01] <triveni> yeah he said to talk to u
[08/01 11:01] <dsk_hbe> fine by me!
[08/01 11:01] <triveni> ok debbie..will do it next week.. 
[08/01 11:01] <06Amit_ZOS> made the change to C$170801
[08/01 11:01] <dsk_hbe> later this week
[08/01 11:02] <06Amit_ZOS> submitting it
[08/01 11:02] <triveni> ok Debbie
[08/01 11:02] <triveni> NZ00.SS.CONFIG.FCARDS.FABC
[08/01 11:02] <dsk_hbe> um, whatcha doing Triveni?
[08/01 11:02] <triveni> will the changes for dw be made this one..
[08/01 11:03] <triveni> nothing m just asking
[08/01 11:03] <dsk_hbe> now, they are in the Pz00 one with DW on the end
[08/01 11:03] <triveni> ok cool
[08/01 11:03] <triveni> got it
[08/01 11:03] <dsk_hbe> ok, cool, cause we'll be doing fabc soon, maybe today, as well... still looking at some stuff
[08/01 11:03] <triveni> ok i ll do fabc then
[08/01 11:05] <dsk_hbe> ok, later... fwiw, dw doesn't use jmenu but we can make the change (along with prod), just won't have any apps to bounce.
[08/01 11:05] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/01 11:06] <dsk_hbe> So you guys know, the PROD one will require app bounces, which we normally do after hours.  I'm going to plan for Friday night.  If that throws a wrench in plans you may have I can just do that piece
[08/01 11:06] <triveni> can i do the bouncing for fabc.. when i made changes to fabc.. 
[08/01 11:06] <dsk_hbe> yes
[08/01 11:06] <triveni> thanks debbie
[08/01 11:06] <dsk_hbe> sure thing
[08/01 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> f cards for c1 is prepped
[08/01 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> E110FCDB J083613
[08/01 11:07] <dsk_hbe> thanks AMit... I'll take a quick peek, but I have no doubt you did what is needed
[08/01 11:15] <06Amit_ZOS> btw, they are changing our seats!
[08/01 11:16] <dsk_hbe> had a heck of a time finding the main job... it routes to regular savrs.  We need to change that.
[08/01 11:17] <dsk_hbe> I'll email Jim to make sure he didnt' do that for a reason
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> which ones? these?
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> E110FCDC J083793
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> E111FCDC J083816
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> E112FCDC J083842
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> E113FCDC J083852
[08/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> E114FCDC J083881
[08/01 11:18] <dsk_hbe> no those were in spool, but E110FCDB had routed to savrs (not second savrs)
[08/01 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> oh
[08/01 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[08/01 11:18] <triveni> a.s
[08/01 11:18] <dsk_hbe> yep
[08/01 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> whats the difference between the two? (not the savrs, the jobs)
[08/01 11:19] <dsk_hbe> the primary one does all the fcard setup and the others make sure all clusters are prepped and ready to pick up the change at C1 SOD
[08/01 11:20] <06Amit_ZOS> so E110FCDB is the primary one.. thats why when i looked into others, they were different kind.. preppy
[08/01 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> btw, this request didnt originate from vickie right?
[08/01 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> for the history file
[08/01 11:24] <dsk_hbe> not from Vickie, from Wayne
[08/01 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> all is good then
[08/01 11:28] <dsk_hbe> anwho... all looks good, thanks Amit.
[08/01 11:29] <dsk_hbe> WOudl you like to ship the STASK to release deployment, askign themt o now do the zlfd piece of the change, or woudl you like me to?
[08/01 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> great! :)
[08/01 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> i can do it
[08/01 11:29] <dsk_hbe> ok, make sure you choose the C1 one ;-)
[08/01 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Changed assignment group to release deployment
[08/01 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> for STASK01056960
[08/01 11:31] <dsk_hbe> did you comment that you have completed the MVS piece and this is now for them to do?
[08/01 11:31] <dsk_hbe> otherwise they'll just ship it back... which is fine I guess
[08/01 11:32] <dsk_hbe> we can close it as easy as they can
[08/01 11:32] <06Amit_ZOS> commenting it in the work notes
[08/01 11:32] <dsk_hbe> cool
[08/01 11:33] <dsk_hbe> ok, I need to pay attention to Wayne for a few.  Thanks again, Amit
[08/01 11:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Sure Debbie! :)

[08/01 11:57] <02charlie> if anyone is interested, you can just TSO SUB ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(TOUCH), and it will make sure your profile dataset is not archived on a number of systems. It submits a job with your UID and the suffix x where x is the system designation it runs on (e.g., I, K, Q, F, D, E, P, H, Y, W, X & Z)
[08/01 11:57] <dsk_hbe> kthx, Charlie!

[08/01 12:46] * ChanServ sets mode: +qo JimE_zOS JimE_zOS
[08/01 12:46] <triveni> Hi Jim
[08/01 12:46] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[08/01 12:47] <dsk_hbe> hiya, Jim!
[08/01 12:50] <JimE_zOS> just a note on the C1 F-Card change.....
[08/01 12:50] <JimE_zOS> while changing the output class is certainly fine. 
[08/01 12:50] <JimE_zOS> I think the TDD job will remain there. 
[08/01 12:50] <JimE_zOS> ie, the output won't route back to the internal cluster. 
[08/01 12:50] <JimE_zOS> (at least I don't think it will) 
[08/01 12:51] <JimE_zOS> might need to add /*ROUTE cards. 
[08/01 12:51] <dsk_hbe> hmm... I think I foudn it in IC savrs... now I gotta go check ;-)
[08/01 12:51] <JimE_zOS> RD made so much of the C1 set-up goofy 
[08/01 12:51] <dsk_hbe> they sure did
[08/01 12:51] <JimE_zOS> and I haven't look ed at the job so maybe I'm not remembering things clearly 
[08/01 12:52] <dsk_hbe> nope, you are right... I foudn it on sysw... wow, I woudl have sworn differently ;-)
[08/01 12:52] <triveni>  /*ROUTE PRINT DCC
[08/01 12:52] <triveni>  /*ROUTE XEQ DCC
[08/01 12:53] <triveni> this is already there
[08/01 12:53] <triveni> what needs to be changed?
[08/01 12:53] <JimE_zOS> perhaps the MSGCLASS=D overrides the /*ROUTE PRINT card...
[08/01 12:54] <dsk_hbe> wait... thsi runs on C
[08/01 12:54] <dsk_hbe> now I'm totally confused
[08/01 12:54] <JimE_zOS> it does....but it spawns things that run elsewhere. 
[08/01 12:54] <triveni> that route card will direct it to  C
[08/01 12:54] <dsk_hbe> yeah, but how did it land in sysw savrs?
[08/01 12:55] <JimE_zOS> but the SAVRS output writter will move it after JES2 puts it where the /*ROUTE cards specify 
[08/01 12:55] <dsk_hbe> and they specify dcc
[08/01 12:55] <dsk_hbe> I am missing something ;-)
[08/01 12:55] <JimE_zOS> yep....so to DCC so that SAVRS can move it to the TDD 
[08/01 12:55] <JimE_zOS> JES first, SAVRS last.  SAVRS wins. 
[08/01 12:56] <triveni> ok
[08/01 12:56] <dsk_hbe> are you saying msgclass=D is sysw??
[08/01 12:56] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[08/01 12:56] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/01 12:56] <JimE_zOS> for all of your PLG needs :-)
[08/01 12:56] <dsk_hbe> thanks... my missing piece... so we're back to only needing the msgclass change, thanks
[08/01 12:56] <dsk_hbe> whew... that hurt my brain ;-)
[08/01 12:56] <JimE_zOS> so it would seem, yes. 
[08/01 12:56] <JimE_zOS> no pain, no gain. :-)
[08/01 12:57] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[08/01 12:57] <triveni> ok
[08/01 12:57] <JimE_zOS> which is why I think I need to take up excessive drinking. 
[08/01 12:57] <triveni> so need to chagne the route cards.. got it..
[08/01 12:57] <dsk_hbe> it's been way too long since I cared to keep msgclass info in there, clearly ;-)
[08/01 12:57] <JimE_zOS> I blame RD
[08/01 12:57] <dsk_hbe> LOL, excessive drinking sounds good
[08/01 12:58] <triveni> M game for that ;)
[08/01 12:58] <JimE_zOS> and I know that'll hurt, therefore I'm "gaining" :-)
[08/01 12:58] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/01 12:59] <triveni> Jim what happened to nwork datasets? do we have to work on it..
[08/01 12:59] <dsk_hbe> I think we have exhausted all the help we can ask for from vacation JIm today ;-)
[08/01 12:59] <triveni> ok Jim.. next week..
[08/01 13:00] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/01 13:00] <triveni> Debbie.. lemme know when do we have to start for fabc..
[08/01 13:00] <JimE_zOS> we'll get there (NWRK), promise. 
[08/01 13:00] <triveni> :)
[08/01 13:00] <JimE_zOS> but remember my rule.  I only make configuration changes during my oncall weeks. 
[08/01 13:01] <dsk_hbe> if you want, Triveni, you can go ahead and prep the Fcards for FABC.  We'll talk abotu the zlfd piece a little later
[08/01 13:01] <triveni> yeah I remember Jim..
[08/01 13:01] <triveni> ok Debbie..
[08/01 13:01] <JimE_zOS> change to FABC ? 
[08/01 13:01] <dsk_hbe> though he has carte blanche (sp?) for my weeks if he ever really has a desire ;-)
[08/01 13:01] <dsk_hbe> max mfr change still, Jim... Wayne asked to increase 10000 to 10500
[08/01 13:05] <06Amit_zOS> nice word to add to my vocab.. carte blanche
[08/01 13:06] <dsk_hbe> I know very little French ;-)
[08/01 13:07] <triveni> fabc job will run at what time debbie
[08/01 13:07] <triveni> 2017/08/01 or 2017/08/02
[08/01 13:07] * JimE_zOS has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[08/01 13:07] <06Amit_zOS> she means to ask when is EOD run for fabc
[08/01 13:08] <dsk_hbe> it is the same as C1... you sub it now and it is prepped... EOD jobs automatically look for it.  
[08/01 13:08] <triveni> ok
[08/01 13:08] <dsk_hbe> we don't need a change request... well, I don't think... true, Jim?
[08/01 13:08] <triveni> Jim left
[08/01 13:09] <dsk_hbe> I'm going wtih we don't then :-)
[08/01 13:10] <triveni> :)

[08/01 13:18] <triveni> the triggered jobs

[08/01 13:18] <triveni> ok Amit
[08/01 13:18] <dsk_hbe> yes, true
[08/01 13:19] <dsk_hbe> sorry, I missed the question I guess
[08/01 13:20] <06Amit_zOS> last time you made a change in february this year you did have a change i guess:CHG0146491
[08/01 13:21] <dsk_hbe> ugh... but I don't wanna
[08/01 13:22] <dsk_hbe> I never know what shodul be official for that... if Jim sees the question, we'll take his answer as official
[08/01 13:23] <triveni> debbie, which datasets should i compare, like in prod we have pl00.lrisa.recf
[08/01 13:23] <triveni> what will be for fabc
[08/01 13:23] <dsk_hbe> does Jim have a compare job in the dataset?  
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> lemme chk
[08/01 13:24] <dsk_hbe> if so, just use that... easier than typing the datasets
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> yes 
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> NL00.LTISA.FABC.SOD.DATA
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> NL00.LTISA.FABC.RECF
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> got it
[08/01 13:24] <triveni> i ll sub the job
[08/01 13:25] <dsk_hbe> cool
[08/01 13:26] <triveni> E1F0FCDM
[08/01 13:26] <triveni> it looks good to me
[08/01 13:26] <dsk_hbe> cool... will peek too in a sec
[08/01 13:26] <triveni> sure!
[08/01 13:27] <JimE_zOS> sorry...trying to talk to TW
[08/01 13:27] <dsk_hbe> ugh, lucky you
[08/01 13:27] <JimE_zOS> no, since FABC is not a prod system, no change request is needed. 
[08/01 13:27] <triveni> cool!
[08/01 13:27] <triveni> Thanks Jim
[08/01 13:27] <dsk_hbe> excellent... I will try to remember this in the future finally
[08/01 13:27] <JimE_zOS> still a good idea if you plan to be off the air for an extended window, but not strickly required. 
[08/01 13:27] <dsk_hbe> they've made change requests so punitive I am glad to do less instead of more
[08/01 13:28] <JimE_zOS> of course Jim has a pre-configured compare job in the F-Card source dataset. 
[08/01 13:28] <JimE_zOS> :-P
[08/01 13:29] <dsk_hbe> I just knew it had to be so ;-)
[08/01 13:29] <triveni> hahhaa.. that helped a lot ;)
[08/01 13:31] <dsk_hbe> all looks good to me too, thanks Triveni

[08/01 14:14] <dsk_hbe> soooo... Triveni... I shodul have asked ont he call... do you need us to watch you bounce the fabc jmenu apps? the only caution is to do them one at a time and make sure the first one is done, back up and processign work, before doing the next.  We currently only run two... one on sysg and one on sysj... besure not to start the ones that are set to down
[08/01 14:14] <triveni> i want to

[08/02 10:09] <02charlie> ok, i thought it was your call, but i just wanted to check. and i would have let one of the kids actually do it :)

[08/02 10:43] * charlie has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 365 seconds)
[08/02 10:45] <06Amit_ZOS> hoping to hear more about this issue during anita's training sessions
[08/02 10:46] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if she will have to cancel those to work on the issue... Joe's still out so she is likely the only one as familiar with the code
[08/02 10:46] <triveni> ohh
[08/02 10:47] <dsk_hbe> are oyu guys getting a McAfee update thing pop-up?  It seems to want to do it asap.  I guess I'll start shutting things down to let that happen.
[08/02 10:47] <triveni> yeah
[08/02 10:47] <dsk_hbe> actually I forgot Charlie is off... I suspended it for 60 minutes
[08/02 10:48] <triveni> its happening to me
[08/02 10:48] <triveni> i postponed it for few mins
[08/02 10:48] <triveni> but its gonna pop up soon
[08/02 10:48] <dsk_hbe> I'll be here for at least 60 minutes if you guys want to let yours go forward I'll watch thngs
[08/02 10:49] <triveni> ok debbie.. lemme find it and i ll start the update..
[08/02 10:49] <06Amit_ZOS> i dont have anything popping up just yet
[08/02 10:49] <06Amit_ZOS> so im good
[08/02 10:49] <dsk_hbe> that's good
[08/02 10:50] <triveni> something started
[08/02 10:57] <triveni> not sure what happened though
[08/02 10:57] <triveni> it finished i guess
[08/02 10:57] <dsk_hbe> it didn't disconnect you?  Mine said it woudl disconnect from VPN to complete the install... hmmm
[08/02 10:58] <triveni> i might hv missed that msg
[08/02 10:58] <triveni> i stepped away for a bit
[08/02 10:58] <triveni> i ll just restart the machine
[08/02 10:58] <triveni> that should take care of it
[08/02 10:59] <dsk_hbe> yeah, might as well beat it to the punch

[08/02 11:04] <dsk_hbe> sure hope not.  I had one do that to me... asid it was going to install/restart at 6pm, so I did it manually, but it later restarted again on it's own.
[08/02 11:04] <triveni> hahaha
[08/02 11:04] <triveni> fingers crossed then ;)

[08/02 12:28] <02charlie> your note to me referred to the master install template, right?
[08/02 12:30] <dsk_hbe> yes, I updated the one out there, but since you are mid-changign it, I wanted to be sure you added that to your changes
[08/02 12:32] <02charlie> sure thx
[08/02 12:35] <02charlie> $@#!^ McAfee is updating and there's nothing I can do to stop it
[08/02 12:36] <dsk_hbe> it asked me if I wanted to postpone, saying I had 2 chances to do so... after I post-poned it for 1 hour, it kicked in and installed without giving me the change to use my second postpone... very rude software ;-)

[08/03 10:24] <dsk_hbe> thsi guy - PKX1FF?  I'm afraid to ask questions in the current political environment ;-)
[08/03 10:25] <dsk_hbe> their searches are many but they are really cheap searches so we have let them run
[08/03 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS>               00073162
[08/03 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> PKX1FF        00072112
[08/03 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> so both of those rows is for the same id?
[08/03 10:28] <triveni_brb> back
[08/03 10:28] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[08/03 10:29] <dsk_hbe> oh that blank... no, I think I told you abotu that before... it is simply because of the way this quick and dirty program runs.  I pull out all the stats to a intermediate file, but since the stats are actually written lines of SOR reporting, there are line breaks between some of them... rather than add code to weed out the line breaks, theyget counted too.  Some day I may decide to eliminate those but it'll just add more code to the 
[08/03 10:29] <dsk_hbe> job so I personally just live with it ;-)
[08/03 10:30] <dsk_hbe> it kind of acts as a barometer for me... if a live user is above the blank's count, I know they are pretty darned high l0(
[08/03 10:30] <dsk_hbe> my smiley got messed up ;-)
[08/03 10:31] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[08/03 11:58] <dsk_hbe> my phone just toldme I slept 13 hours and 45 minutes last night... riiiiight ;-)
[08/03 11:59] <dsk_hbe> I need to fix that app's point of view ;-)

[08/03 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> so accurate
[08/03 12:00] <dsk_hbe> yeah, it's some app I loaded up that uses my Apple watch info.

[08/03 14:22] <06Amit_zOS> dont know.. will look into smapi
[08/03 14:22] <dsk_hbe> I meant where are you seeing him?  I diary stats?  He's Diligence so may very well be a good person to suspect... go, Amit, go :-)
[08/03 14:23] <06Amit_zOS> yes in diaries
[08/03 14:24] <06Amit_zOS> darts
[08/03 14:24] <dsk_hbe> so the darts?
[08/03 14:24] <dsk_hbe> jinx
[08/03 14:24] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[08/03 14:24] <dsk_hbe> I forget how many beers you owe me by now ;-)
[08/03 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> oh, jinx means free beer? I wonder why no one told me about that tradition!
[08/03 14:25] <dsk_hbe> the normal comment is 'jinx, you owe me a beer'... but it's quicker to when the jinx to leave that part off ;-)
[08/03 14:25] <dsk_hbe> and if Jim wins a jinx, I believe he doesn't drink beer so the beverage is negotiable ;-)
[08/03 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[08/03 14:26] <dsk_hbe> when = win... good grief... my brain!!!
[08/03 14:27] <06Amit_zOS> cool..
[08/03 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> still not sure, how exactly i need to filter searches in smapi to see what he is doing..
[08/03 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> i just got this when i asked it to give me for which RT > 4s

[08/03 14:31] <dsk_hbe> its taking a whiel to open for me
[08/03 14:31] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/03 14:33] <dsk_hbe> fnally opened... those are all PQs
[08/03 14:34] <06Amit_zOS> how would you search in smapi Debbie? to see what they were doing..
[08/03 14:36] <dsk_hbe> what kinds of response time values are you seeing in the DARTs.  Are they FG mostly or BG mostly?
[08/03 14:36] <dsk_hbe> maybe if they are FG, you can try a lower value... we have high expectations for FG response time
[08/03 14:36] <06Amit_zOS> FG
[08/03 14:36] * Not_the_droid_youre_seeking has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08/03 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> in diaries, i usually pay attention to FG only
[08/03 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> I tried giving 1s before.. but that returned more than 300 results
[08/03 14:38] <dsk_hbe> ok, so as you know, Wayne's goal is to have FG ART be below .7-.8... though that will change when we recondif the FG/BG mix.  So maybe look for a lower response value for filtering... or even get an idea of what his maxes are on those darts and go with that?
[08/03 14:38] <dsk_hbe> reconfig* sigh
[08/03 14:38] <dsk_hbe> how many darts did you see him in?  maybe if they are all around the same time, filter just around those times
[08/03 14:38] * charlie has joined #theRock
[08/03 14:40] <06Amit_zOS> most are at 2 55
[08/03 14:41] <dsk_hbe> I'm goign to look at your diaries to see what you mean there

[08/03 14:44] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... I only see a small handful on each LSR cluster.  I'm not sure that worries me.
[08/03 14:44] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/03 14:45] <dsk_hbe> if all of them were for the 02:55 timestamp and you still want to look, you could filter down to 02:50-02:55 and leave off the response time filter value
[08/03 14:45] <06Amit_zOS> still more than 300
[08/03 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> 02:50-02:53 itself is more than 300
[08/03 14:46] <06Amit_zOS> and 02:54-02:55 returns nothing
[08/03 14:46] <dsk_hbe> yep... I see in the PQS tool that one of the webIDs out there has 600 PQs and looks like most indeed run in the 02:00 hour.
[08/03 14:46] <dsk_hbe> checkign the other webid
[08/03 14:47] <dsk_hbe> the second webID has 237 searches and also all running int he 02:00 hour.  I'd say with the few DARTs the LexisID got out of all of that, we served them very well
[08/03 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/03 14:48] <dsk_hbe> the small handful I have opened up say they were saved quite a while ago, so not new searches.  If they haven't caused trouble by now, I doubt the few DARTs tou see him in are a concern.
[08/03 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> i knew they were not a concern unless they stand out like a sore thumb tomorrow.. 
[08/03 14:50] <dsk_hbe> since the data in those DART messages is all wall time, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  If the system is otherwise not terribly busy, any user might land as the highest user... just depends on the other load running at the same time
[08/03 14:50] <06Amit_zOS> just happened to see this guy on my routine afternoon checkout
[08/03 14:50] <dsk_hbe> never a bad thing to look at proactively though... especially when they are Diligence.  Their searches can be pigs
[08/03 14:52] <06Amit_zOS> :)

[08/04 11:40] <dsk_hbe> I like to hope so! :-)
[08/04 11:40] <06Amit_ZOS> you know.. as a virtue of being one of those people!

[08/04 13:23] <dsk_hbe> Triveni, you there?
[08/04 13:24] <dsk_hbe> helloooooooo? busy packing???
[08/04 13:25] <triveni> hi
[08/04 13:25] <dsk_hbe> hiya!
[08/04 13:25] <triveni> m here
[08/04 13:25] <dsk_hbe> can you do me a favor?
[08/04 13:25] <triveni> yes debbie
[08/04 13:25] <dsk_hbe> I have no idea what my cert lexis.com ID is right now.  IF you have a usable one, can you sign into cdc5 and see if you sign in ok?
[08/04 13:25] <triveni> ok
[08/04 13:25] <dsk_hbe> thanks!!
[08/04 13:27] <triveni> a big paste coming

[08/04 13:27] <triveni> i thought my id works
[08/04 13:28] <triveni> and its not expired yet
[08/04 13:28] <dsk_hbe> exactly what I suspected... thanks so much!  Bobbie is having trouble as well and I wanted to make sure it wasn't just her
[08/04 13:28] <triveni> ok cool
[08/04 13:28] <dsk_hbe> try cdc12 and I suspect you'll get in
[08/04 13:28] <triveni> ok
[08/04 13:28] <triveni> never tried cdc12
[08/04 13:28] <dsk_hbe> I think if you just replace the '5' with a '12' in the url it will do it.
[08/04 13:28] <triveni> ok
[08/04 13:30] <triveni> yup logged in
[08/04 13:30] <triveni> so cdc12 its cert
[08/04 13:30] <triveni> i mean fabc types
[08/04 13:31] <dsk_hbe> it is cert, but uses spce backend... the issue here isn't with the backend though... cdc5 seems sick
[08/04 13:33] <triveni> ohh
[08/04 13:33] <triveni> ok
[08/04 13:33] <triveni> I hope they fix it 
[08/04 13:33] <dsk_hbe> yeah, Bobbie needs it for metadata checkout

[08/04 14:40] <dsk_hbe> hopefully it will work now... the bounces didn't help, as Amit saw, but now they have fixed a path parm for the UIS app and it seemed to fix things.  There was a change last night related to the oracle upgrade and they missed the cdc5 UIS
[08/04 14:40] <dsk_hbe> yay!  glad to see you were successful!

[08/04 14:53] <triveni> Jim is in completely different space
[08/04 14:53] <dsk_hbe> are you closer or farther away from Wayne?
[08/04 14:54] <06Amit_ZOS> closer to wayne.. i suppose im sitting right below Anita

[08/04 14:55] <dsk_hbe> oh ok... for some reason I thought you already were close to ANit and Eric.  weren't you in the same pod as Hankins?  or was it beyond Hankins?
[08/04 14:55] <dsk_hbe> oh ok, I gotcha then... volleyball court helps

[08/07 11:13] <02charlie> yeah, the only smart motorcycle purchase i ever heard of when wehn judge schnorr restired, he bought a motorcycle

[08/08 09:42] <02charlie> yeah, debbie, i sent a personal note to Anna about that ticket, and then put some comments in the ticket itself

[08/08 09:44] <02charlie> since she wrote the t/o note
[08/08 09:44] <dsk_hbe> I see you are playing Big Brother on me... you must see me 'viewing' the ticket ;-)
[08/08 09:44] <02charlie> lol
[08/08 09:45] <02charlie> yes, indeed
[08/08 09:45] <dsk_hbe> Was jus making sure it didn't land with our devs ;-)
[08/08 09:46] <02charlie> yeah, it doesnt need to go to our devs, but i saw it was owned by some offshore contractor, so i just put the note in there
[08/08 09:46] <02charlie> if it had gone to one of the devs, i probably would have taken it back and resolved it
[08/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> I struggle with trying to get them to have a clue that we support FABC (and that FABC is even involved here) and giving up and being glad we didn't get paged :-/
[08/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> on a non-problem
[08/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> if it were a real problem the struggle woudl be more real
[08/08 09:47] <02charlie> yeah, and also trying to get them to understand that is normal at the fabc downtown
[08/08 09:47] <dsk_hbe> hence 'non-problem'
[08/08 09:48] <02charlie> time, not town :)
[08/08 09:48] <02charlie> yes

[08/08 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> i thought you dont have to remember stuff.. you use something like a key manager to do that for you right!?
[08/08 09:53] <02charlie> yeah, but i still have to remember the 3270 and unix ones
[08/08 09:55] <02charlie> it's like it's not recognizing that it's a mod 5

[08/08 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> approach a problem!?
[08/08 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> although approach a solution sounds refreshigly pleasant!
[08/08 14:38] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/08 14:39] * triveni has joined #theRock
[08/08 14:39] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[08/08 14:39] <charlie_away> appraoch a solution, i already have the problem :)
[08/08 14:40] <06Amit_zOS> :-P
[08/08 14:40] <charlie_away> :D
[08/08 14:40] <charlie_away> i think my new daughter-in-law has a new job! woohoo!
[08/08 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> Congratulations to HeR!!!!!!!
[08/08 14:41] <dsk_hbe> gainfully employed is alway s agood thing!
[08/08 14:41] <charlie_away> not close by, but the offer was like, but much nicer than, the horse's head in the bed in The Godfather :)
[08/08 14:42] <dsk_hbe> what does she do?
[08/08 14:42] <charlie_away> yeah, this will be one full time job that can replace three of the four part time jobs
[08/08 14:42] <charlie_away> PhD in English
[08/08 14:43] <charlie_away> she'll be in charge of the ESL program in the schools district where she lives
[08/08 14:43] <dsk_hbe> very nice!
[08/08 14:43] <charlie_away> yeah, i think she'll be dropping the two adjunct teaching positions
[08/08 14:43] <dsk_hbe> that is a huge program down here as you might imagine... big inOhio too?
[08/08 14:43] <charlie_away> PA, but yes
[08/08 14:44] <charlie_away> like i said, not close to us, but it's where she lives
[08/08 14:44] <dsk_hbe> closer than some other places though!  easy road trip
[08/08 14:44] <charlie_away> yes, only 8 hrs
[08/08 14:45] <charlie_away> and it will put her in a position to be abe to move somewhere else later
[08/08 14:45] <charlie_away> able
[08/08 14:45] <dsk_hbe> Amit, being the adventurous person you are, I wonder, do you ski?
[08/08 14:45] <dsk_hbe> very nice, Charlie
[08/08 14:45] <charlie_away> yeah, we're very pleased
[08/08 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> No Debbie.. I haven't yet
[08/08 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> i would love to sometime..
[08/08 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> grad studies didnt give a lot of free time.. its only now that i'm gainfully employed and have some time I could use productively
[08/08 14:49] <dsk_hbe> Charlie's mention of Pennsylvania made me think of it.  I learned to ski at a dinky place in central Ohio... I assume it's still there, but Seven Springs in Pennsylvania is not far and, at least 30 years ago, was very nice for beginner to intermediate skiing
[08/08 14:49] <dsk_hbe> gainfully emplyed... it's what we all hope for for our children ;-)
[08/08 14:50] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[08/08 14:52] <dsk_hbe> Mad River Mountain... that's the dinky place in Ohio... looks like it's still there
[08/08 14:53] <dsk_hbe> put it on your list for winter adventure... I'll expect a report back ;-)
[08/08 14:55] <06Amit_zOS> Aye aye captain!
[08/08 14:55] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/08 14:55] <dsk_hbe> though my daughter tells me the in thing for the younger generation is snowboarding... whatever... looks easy to me ;-)
[08/08 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> My cousin brother from columbus is terrified of skeeing cz he has had many falls in his attempts! I'm looking forward to this winter though!
[08/08 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> I almost miss the snow
[08/08 14:57] <dsk_hbe> skiing was the only thign I coudl find to help me tolerate it
[08/08 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> Nice!
[08/08 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> I didn't know you were so into it! You miss it in Texas?
[08/08 14:59] <dsk_hbe> I haven't done it in a very long time.  Probably 30 years.  But I enjoyed it when I did.  Used to go on annual trips to bigger places in Colorado and Utah with a large group of friends from work.  I'm afraid I'd break something now ;-)
[08/08 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> Nice! Utah i've heard is great for skeeing
[08/08 15:01] <dsk_hbe> yeah, Park City is where we went.  very nice
[08/08 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> they market it by saying its 'the best snow in the world'
[08/08 15:01] <dsk_hbe> hahaha
[08/08 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> I had an admit to the university of utah too..
[08/08 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> i chose buffalo over  it
[08/08 15:03] <dsk_hbe> I can't imagine which was worse for cold ;-)
[08/08 15:03] <06Amit_zOS> Buffalo was worse for snow in general.. but both the winters I endured were kind enough..
[08/08 15:04] <06Amit_zOS> not as bad as my seniors had exaggerated
[08/08 15:04] <dsk_hbe> you may have just lucked into an 'easy' year... seems we have had a couple recently
[08/08 15:05] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[08/08 15:05] <06Amit_zOS> exactly
[08/08 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> have a question for anita.. brb.. have a good rest of the day Debbie! :-)
[08/08 15:06] <dsk_hbe> bye!
[08/08 15:06] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/08 15:12] <triveni> b
[08/08 15:13] <triveni> Debbie.. I have skieed..
[08/08 15:13] <triveni> it was fun
[08/08 15:14] <triveni> and dis weekend i went to canooeing..
[08/08 15:14] <triveni> ;)
[08/08 15:14] <dsk_hbe> wow, you are adventurous too!!
[08/08 15:14] <triveni> I am not into adventure sports but luckily my frend circle is always upto something..
[08/08 15:15] <dsk_hbe> where did you canoe?
[08/08 15:15] <triveni> and i have a tendency to roll in with the crowd
[08/08 15:15] <triveni> move with the flow.
[08/08 15:15] <triveni> bellbrook
[08/08 15:15] <triveni> water is not deep at all..but it was something to play..
[08/08 15:15] <triveni> sugarcreek exactly
[08/08 15:15] <dsk_hbe> that's abotu the way I was at your age.  It led to some crazy things, like white water rafting... for someone who can't swim that probably wasn't smart looking back ;-)
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> i dont know how to swim
[08/08 15:16] <dsk_hbe> nice!  and where did you ski?  was that in college?
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> but i have done river rafting
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> and also rope rowing kind of stuff..
[08/08 15:16] <dsk_hbe> we're the same amount of crazy apparently ;-)
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> when u just walk across the river through rope
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> yeah in college here..
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> in newyork
[08/08 15:16] <triveni> i ll hv to check the place
[08/08 15:17] <dsk_hbe> oh my... I take it back... you;re a little crazier... rope walking???
[08/08 15:17] <triveni> hahha
[08/08 15:17] <dsk_hbe> I've skiied someplace in new york too but I can't remember teh name of it
[08/08 15:18] <triveni> well i meant newyork state
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> it was in cortland 
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> greek peak mountain resort
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> just checked my facebook 
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> ;)
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> it was real fun
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> I fell so many times..but loved it..
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> i have fear of heights and water..
[08/08 15:19] <triveni> but i still do everything.. its the thrill..
[08/08 15:20] <triveni> i have never overcome it...i still fear them ;)
[08/08 15:21] <dsk_hbe> I don't have a fear of heights, but can't do deep water... my 4 ft. pool is my limit ;-)
[08/08 15:21] <triveni> hahhaah
[08/08 15:24] <dsk_hbe> have you zip-lined yet?  you need to add that to your to-do list ;-)  that'll challenge your fear of heights a little ;-)
[08/08 15:25] <triveni> i guess that's called zip-lining
[08/08 15:25] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/08 15:25] <dsk_hbe> yes
[08/08 15:25] <triveni> i was not able to recollect it
[08/08 15:25] <triveni> yes
[08/08 15:25] <dsk_hbe> fun... I'd definitely do that again
[08/08 15:25] <triveni> but water was beneath it
[08/08 15:26] <triveni> and it will be slant so u ll fell into water
[08/08 15:26] <dsk_hbe> I'll pas on that one ;-)
[08/08 15:26] <triveni> but the height was not too scaryy one..
[08/08 15:26] <triveni> i can see zipllining people do it from a higher altitude.. i can probably try it someday too..
[08/08 15:28] <dsk_hbe> the one I did wasn't terribly high.  I'll probably stick with non-water and not terribly high ;-)
[08/08 15:28] <triveni> ;)

[08/09 00:31] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Amit. 
[08/09 00:31] <JimE_zOS> you should join us on #fabSup 
[08/09 00:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim.. I am on there
[08/09 00:31] <06Amit_ZOS> i watching from the sidelines
[08/09 00:31] <JimE_zOS> k
[08/09 00:31] <06Amit_ZOS> i will let you drive and at the end see if I can learn something
[08/09 00:39] <06Amit_ZOS> When did this start Jim? the CREXCP messages?
[08/09 00:41] <06Amit_ZOS> and what's ss for them?
[08/09 00:51] <JimE_zOS> "ss" in this case is stylesheet. 
[08/09 00:52] <JimE_zOS> as to start, the messages are in yesterday's diary....probably older diary data too (but I didn't look beyond yesterda) 
[08/09 00:52] <JimE_zOS> I think this really only got attention because somebody new was checking the diary data. 
[08/09 00:53] <JimE_zOS> glad they didn't freak out with teh "element has kids" message.  Tons and tons and tons of those. 
[08/09 00:53] <06Amit_ZOS> okay.. just noticed we had an updated version of CREXCP go in on our last MVS release
[08/09 00:53] <06Amit_ZOS> ah..
[08/09 00:54] <JimE_zOS> we'd have to read the SPI to know what changed.  
[08/09 00:54] <JimE_zOS> could have been something as small as a DSECT change. 
[08/09 00:54] <06Amit_ZOS> hmm.
[08/09 00:54] <06Amit_ZOS> Wayne was the one who made that change.. so he could help us
[08/09 00:55] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway, thanks Jim
[08/09 00:56] <JimE_zOS> we can look more tomorrow, Amit. 
[08/09 00:56] <JimE_zOS> G & Q night! 
[08/09 00:56] <JimE_zOS> and thanks for joining!

[08/09 09:36] <02charlie> amit, did you see the numbers i posted?
[08/09 09:36] <triveni> is it from diarie charile
[08/09 09:37] <triveni> diary**
[08/09 09:37] <02charlie> yeah, they're the number of CREXCP/0009W messages from 8/1 to date
[08/09 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> yes Charlie 
[08/09 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> i just did
[08/09 09:39] <02charlie> ok, didnt know if they had dissappeared into the ether :)
[08/09 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Yesterday a funny thing happened though.. i ran diaries and all of them were empty
[08/09 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> no idea why
[08/09 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> couldnt find the job in spool too
[08/09 09:43] <06Amit_ZOS> working today though\
[08/09 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> and i dont quite understand what those 9W messages mean
[08/09 09:46] <02charlie> they're warning about a possible stylesheet issue, 9Ws are always paired with 10Ws
[08/09 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> oh W=Warning
[08/09 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> and whats 3740? a stylesheet number?
[08/09 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> or db num?
[08/09 09:47] <02charlie> no, the number of such messages on 8/1
[08/09 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> oh!
[08/09 09:47] <02charlie> the numbers for for the dates 8/1 thru 8/8
[08/09 09:47] <triveni> ok
[08/09 09:47] <02charlie> are for
[08/09 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[08/09 09:48] <triveni> charlie do you have those numbers in any of ur mvs reports?
[08/09 09:48] <triveni> can i check it in mvs side
[08/09 09:50] <02charlie> you can see the numbers here http://sysgip/MVSDS/'ULESTCX.PROD.LCRE.CSV.F170101.T170808' and here http://sysgip/MVSDS/'ULESTCX.PROD.FDSR.CSV.F170101.T170808', but it's an ugly presentation. I download and convert to excel
[08/09 09:52] <triveni> thanks charlie
[08/09 09:52] <02charlie> the mvs dataset name is embedded in the URL between the quotes, so you can go to that dataset directly
[08/09 09:53] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 09:53] <triveni> i can see it
[08/09 10:08] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, on your diary jobs not workign last night.  It woudl take a long while to try to figure that out now because the jobs are gone, but let me give you somethign to look at next time.  Whenever we sub these mega diary jobs, there are actually some jobs that run prior to the one you find running under your name.  For example.  For a CL4 diary, ZDRYA4, ZDRYE4, and ZDRYM4 run, in that order, to do some needed setup before your 
[08/09 10:09] <dsk_hbe> UNENMAX4 job runs.  Those jobs stay on spool for a while, but yours from last night are gone now.
[08/09 10:09] <dsk_hbe> If this happens to you again, you might look for those jobs and see if they hold a clue for why your diary didn't work.  Today's are out on spool if you want to peek at them and get an idea of what each does.
[08/09 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning to you too Debbie! :D
[08/09 10:11] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/09 10:12] <dsk_hbe> no surprise here , but you can thank Jim for these Z jobs... used to be the predecessor jobs just vanished and it was very difficult to figure out when something went wrong.  He changed them to hang around for a while with these Z jobnames
[08/09 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[08/09 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> good.. next time, i wont be so clueles
[08/09 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> clueless*
[08/09 10:14] <dsk_hbe> nothing more frustrating when you are working a problem to not have your tools work!
[08/09 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> true
[08/09 10:55] <triveni> I can see TIMEM2 abline in cluster 1
[08/09 10:55] <triveni>  i checked in abline reports
[08/09 10:55] <triveni> it seems new
[08/09 10:56] <triveni> 104245 1406 AB-B9MVM09,0001,04,IJKFNGNB,3287,3692,01,    ,TIMEM2+01A74T##
[08/09 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> it occured on 08/07 and 08/03
[08/09 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> how many did you find?
[08/09 10:57] <triveni> its 3
[08/09 10:57] <triveni> and in may it occured just 3
[08/09 10:58] <triveni> i ll just check what is TIMEM2..
[08/09 10:58] <06Amit_ZOS> its actually 2
[08/09 10:58] <triveni> yeah 
[08/09 10:59] <06Amit_ZOS> not counting the ##..
[08/09 11:01] <dsk_hbe> that ID shows up here and tehre so I'd bet money he casued himself issues ;-)
[08/09 11:04] <triveni> I checked it in code for 004 code
[08/09 11:04] <triveni> it says TIMEMG    ALL TASKS TRYING TO GET CORE
[08/09 11:05] <dsk_hbe> yeah... I'm in a meeting, but ran this summary job... it spits out some fields in all teh UCEs from the dump... you can see here that this guy owns more core than anyone else... so I stand by my first statement ;-)  JOB(UKAMBDSA,154366) on SYSC
[08/09 11:06] <JimE_zOS> howdy
[08/09 11:06] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/09 11:06] <triveni> Hey Jim
[08/09 11:06] <dsk_hbe> better pay attention to this mtg, hi Jim!
[08/09 11:08] <triveni> Jim.. v r here.. if u need us..
[08/09 11:09] <06Amit_ZOS> Hi Jim! Good Morning!
[08/09 11:25] <02charlie> good morning jim
[08/09 11:26] <02charlie> sorry meeting and then comfort break
[08/09 11:26] <02charlie> the TIMEM2+01A74 abends you spotted today have nly happened on 6 other days this year
[08/09 11:27] <02charlie> and i show it as TIMEM2+01A74 HIGBLOCK CORE ABEND (punched task with high core u
[08/09 11:28] <02charlie> and of course rule 1 applies :)
[08/09 11:28] <02charlie> only=nly
[08/09 11:33] <JimE_zOS> given the lateness of the day, I think I'll just stay HBE.  
[08/09 11:33] <JimE_zOS> making coffee....BRB 
[08/09 11:36] <02charlie> that makes perfect sense to me, jim
[08/09 11:37] <02charlie> btw, when you're back, i didnt think INC01609912 was a racf issue, and thus probably shouldnt have come to us/you. am i correct?
[08/09 11:47] <JimE_zOS> back 
[08/09 11:47] <JimE_zOS> looking, Charlie. 
[08/09 11:47] <02charlie> i'll be happy to send it on
[08/09 11:49] <JimE_zOS> sure...boot it, please. 
[08/09 11:50] <02charlie> will do, i wanted to check with you before i did :D
[08/09 11:50] <JimE_zOS> it is sometimes hard to tell. 
[08/09 11:51] <JimE_zOS> and most people sending in security tickets aren't bright enough to work here. 
[08/09 11:51] <02charlie> lol
[08/09 11:51] <JimE_zOS> ....or in any IT related field. 
[08/09 11:52] <JimE_zOS> I've even seen tickets that were from somebody who really only had a brain stem.  
[08/09 11:53] <02charlie> rotflmao
[08/09 11:54] <triveni> lol
[08/09 11:56] <JimE_zOS> I have homework for Amit and Triveni.  (with no help from Debbie or Charlie), I'd like each of you to build, please, JCL that will allocate valid SR NWRK datasets.  Keep in mind that FG and BG allocations are different and you'll need to allow for that difference. 
[08/09 11:56] <triveni> ok
[08/09 11:56] <JimE_zOS> also keep in mind that some copies will need two sets of NWKS...you'll need to allow for that too. 
[08/09 11:57] <JimE_zOS> HINT:  Don't forget the CONTIG parm.  REQUIRED. 
[08/09 11:57] <02charlie> ok
[08/09 11:57] <triveni> yeah 
[08/09 11:57] <triveni> what name should v give
[08/09 11:58] <JimE_zOS> for now, let's just say something starting with PZ00.  We'll work out those details later. 
[08/09 11:58] <triveni> ok
[08/09 11:58] <triveni> got it
[08/09 11:58] <triveni> I ll create for cluster 1
[08/09 11:58] <JimE_zOS> sure....and Amit has Cluster 2 
[08/09 11:59] <JimE_zOS> oh, I guess I need to give you VOLSER info, don't I? 
[08/09 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[08/09 11:59] <JimE_zOS> the new NWRK pool is LNx9PA - LNx9PP (16 volumes) where x is the cluster number. 
[08/09 11:59] <triveni> its in the mail
[08/09 11:59] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 12:00] <JimE_zOS> true enough....but in case the email isn't handy, details above. 
[08/09 12:00] <triveni> Aye Aye Captain!!
[08/09 12:00] <JimE_zOS> :-)
[08/09 12:01] <JimE_zOS> k...gonna slam some coffee and asprin.  Back later. 
[08/09 12:01] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/09 12:21] <02charlie> jimP took the ticket off our hands and routed it to the UNix admin support team
[08/09 12:31] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, what would be the DCB attributes for the nwrks?
[08/09 12:31] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 12:31] <triveni> like its record length etc
[08/09 12:31] <triveni> and tracks primary secondary
[08/09 12:33] <triveni> can v check the attributes of the existing Nwork datasets.. as they are PL00, am trying not to touch them..
[08/09 12:50] <06Amit_ZOS> Charlie, N008CH is a total patent user right?
[08/09 12:50] <06Amit_ZOS> why is he here?
[08/09 12:51] <dsk_hbe> I had to peek at that ticket because, well, it came from Ed... he never fails to disappoint... the TP user... what Amit said... not ours :-(
[08/09 12:51] <02charlie> exactly
[08/09 12:51] <dsk_hbe> the others being entitlement issues... why the heck woudl that be ours?
[08/09 12:51] <06Amit_ZOS> i had no clue what that search was about! 
[08/09 12:52] <dsk_hbe> sometimes that part doesn't matter ;-)
[08/09 12:52] <dsk_hbe> well, to us ;-)
[08/09 12:52] <dsk_hbe> that's quite a mess though isn't it?
[08/09 12:52] <06Amit_ZOS> it was!
[08/09 12:52] <dsk_hbe> ok, back to not bashing people (for now ;-)
[08/09 12:53] <06Amit_ZOS> i was just looking for ANY part of it that does matter to us and i could only find N008CH
[08/09 12:53] <dsk_hbe> the product codes tell us it's TP too - prod: 78/780
[08/09 12:53] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. back to Jim's homework.. or should i say work-work
[08/09 12:54] <dsk_hbe> :-D
[08/09 13:03] <dsk_hbe> tidbit from Vickie's meeting... even though Hankins' projections have the retirement of LDC stretchign into 2018, he learned at meetings with management types that it may actually happen before year end... then again, they're managers ;-)
[08/09 13:07] <02charlie> hmm
[08/09 13:08] <dsk_hbe> whaetever %-)
[08/09 13:09] <02charlie> i guess he doesnt want to actually check the tp errors
[08/09 13:09] <02charlie> :-|
[08/09 13:09] <dsk_hbe> he's a trip for sure
[08/09 13:16] <JimE_zOS> back 
[08/09 13:17] <triveni> jim..
[08/09 13:17] <triveni> its length
[08/09 13:17] <02charlie> i made an entry in my status report for that ticket
[08/09 13:17] <JimE_zOS> yeah....that would be left to self discovery. 
[08/09 13:18] <triveni> can i search for existing nwork datasets
[08/09 13:18] <triveni> is it ok to look for its info
[08/09 13:18] <JimE_zOS> ie, if I tell you all that, I've almost given you the JCL. 
[08/09 13:18] <triveni> the pl00 datasets
[08/09 13:18] <JimE_zOS> I suggest that you start by looking at the FABC NWRK datasets 
[08/09 13:18] <triveni> ok
[08/09 13:18] <triveni> got it
[08/09 13:19] <JimE_zOS> although doing a 3.4, I on a production NWRK won't hurt anything. 
[08/09 13:19] <triveni> ok
[08/09 13:19] <JimE_zOS> in general, NWRK datasets are pretty forgiving. 
[08/09 13:19] <JimE_zOS> LCF, not so much 
[08/09 13:20] <triveni> ok
[08/09 13:20] <triveni> thanks for the tip Jim ;)
[08/09 13:22] <JimE_zOS> once you build your JCL, we'll discuss all of hte setttings and values so they make sense. 
[08/09 13:22] <triveni> ok
[08/09 13:28] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[08/09 13:29] <triveni> Jim
[08/09 13:29] <triveni> should i paste my Jcl here
[08/09 13:29] <triveni> just the dd parameters part
[08/09 13:30] <triveni> u can just check here..
[08/09 13:30] <JimE_zOS> why don't you go ahead and build a JCL member, Triveni. 
[08/09 13:30] <triveni> i did that
[08/09 13:30] <triveni> i haven't ran the job though
[08/09 13:31] <JimE_zOS> cause I'll want you to run your job, at some point. 
[08/09 13:31] <triveni> can i do a test run
[08/09 13:31] <triveni> i ll delete the pz00 dataset later
[08/09 13:31] <JimE_zOS> let me look first, please. 
[08/09 13:31] <triveni> ok
[08/09 13:31] <06Amit_ZOS> back
[08/09 13:31] <triveni> UBANPTX.ISPF.JCLLIB(NWRK)
[08/09 13:32] <triveni> i hv just made one step
[08/09 13:32] <triveni> if the allocations look good
[08/09 13:32] <triveni> i ll create more steps
[08/09 13:32] <JimE_zOS> k....looking. 
[08/09 13:34] <triveni> sorry i know..what is wrong
[08/09 13:34] <JimE_zOS> I think UR JCL will run, but I'm not sure that will create a valid NWRK dataset.   The primary and secondary allocation don't seem to reflect FG or BG values. 
[08/09 13:34] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 13:34] <triveni> i put extent
[08/09 13:34] <triveni> it should be tracks
[08/09 13:34] <JimE_zOS> also, does a secondary allocation really go with CONTIG? 
[08/09 13:35] <triveni> TRK,(5000,0),,CONTIG
[08/09 13:36] <JimE_zOS> better. 
[08/09 13:36] <triveni> cool
[08/09 13:36] <triveni> and the rest looked good right
[08/09 13:36] <triveni> ?
[08/09 13:37] <JimE_zOS> yeah...I think that will work.   But I want to share some advice I got in HS calculus class.  It applies to JCL, belive it or not. 
[08/09 13:37] <triveni> sure Jim..
[08/09 13:38] <triveni> tell us
[08/09 13:38] <JimE_zOS> I was working a problem at the board, finished and the teacher ack'ed that I had the correct answer but he didn't like the way I applied the rule
[08/09 13:38] <06Amit_ZOS> Ok.. so i would be using the UNENMAX.ISPF.JCLLIB(NWALCT) member per copy
[08/09 13:38] <JimE_zOS> he said that I needed to apply the rule in exactly the same order each and every time. 
[08/09 13:39] <JimE_zOS> so being equal wasn't enough, he wanted me to develop a habit so that I wouldn't make mistakes. 
[08/09 13:39] <triveni> u want me to use variables..
[08/09 13:39] <triveni> rather than hardcoded values
[08/09 13:40] <JimE_zOS> so the point as it applies to JCL is that you could the DD stuff in the same order each and every time.  No matter what. 
[08/09 13:40] <JimE_zOS> so that you don't forget something 
[08/09 13:40] <triveni> ok got ur point
[08/09 13:40] <JimE_zOS> if you look at my JCL, you will find that it all looks the same no matter what I'm building. 
[08/09 13:40] <triveni> ok 
[08/09 13:40] <JimE_zOS> and as a result, I make very few JCL errors. 
[08/09 13:40] <triveni> I ll try to follow a pattern.
[08/09 13:41] <06Amit_ZOS> dsn,dcb,disp,space, unit and volser
[08/09 13:41] <06Amit_ZOS> that the formula?
[08/09 13:42] <JimE_zOS> that's the order I use, Amit, yes. 
[08/09 13:42] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/09 13:42] <triveni> i have ordered my mess..
[08/09 13:43] <triveni> it looks more organized now
[08/09 13:43] <JimE_zOS> and you don't have to follow the order I do.  I just want you to develop a mental checklist of things you need in a DD statement. 
[08/09 13:44] <triveni> yes got ur point Jim.. and that makes sense too.. 
[08/09 13:44] <JimE_zOS> if you do that, whatever order you want....will help you build more accurate JCL. 
[08/09 13:44] <06Amit_ZOS> awesome!
[08/09 13:44] <JimE_zOS> that, BTW, is all I remember for HS calc.  That and how to take the derivative of a polynomial. 
[08/09 13:44] <triveni> I will replicate it for other datasets
[08/09 13:45] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[08/09 13:45] <triveni> math always my first love.. calculus <3
[08/09 13:45] <triveni> ;)
[08/09 13:45] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, is it okay if I get some lunch before we go ahead and submit the jobs? Or shall I submit and go?
[08/09 13:46] <02charlie> we didnt have calculus for HS classes, but i had a friend show me soe stuff, so my hs math teacher let me do calculus for my last year of hs
[08/09 13:46] <triveni> ;)
[08/09 13:46] <JimE_zOS> sure....lunch is fine. 
[08/09 13:46] <JimE_zOS> go....be free 
[08/09 13:46] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks!
[08/09 13:46] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[08/09 13:46] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/09 13:46] <02charlie> as i recall, derivatives are easy, intergrals are hard :)
[08/09 13:47] <triveni> but i loved dem equally
[08/09 13:47] <02charlie> ignore speling errors pls :)
[08/09 13:47] <triveni> it was real fun
[08/09 13:47] <triveni> :D
[08/09 13:47] <triveni> once u start practicing it.. the more tougher the integral gets..u ll enjoy it more..
[08/09 13:48] <triveni> and yeah derivatives will be a little easier than integrals..
[08/09 13:49] <JimE_zOS> I got by in calc....but I loved BASIC programming class.  I had a teach who was really tall (6.5 feet +) and he took off for spelling errors in comments. 
[08/09 13:49] <triveni> we had calculus even in our engineering.. Hs builded our basics while the real fight was in bachelors degree..
[08/09 13:49] <triveni> you mean the language "BASIC"
[08/09 13:49] <JimE_zOS> so I routinely created program listing longer than he was tall.  He was lazy so he just gave me a perfect score everytime. 
[08/09 13:49] <triveni> GOTO commands
[08/09 13:50] <02charlie> most of my serious calculus was in college
[08/09 13:50] <JimE_zOS> yes, BASIC language. 
[08/09 13:50] <triveni> yeah I loved dat too
[08/09 13:50] <triveni> I was good at it
[08/09 13:50] <triveni> scored full marks
[08/09 13:50] <triveni> heeheh
[08/09 13:50] <02charlie> we had no programming classes
[08/09 13:50] <02charlie> if you wanted to use the college computer, you had to teach yourself
[08/09 13:51] <triveni> ;)
[08/09 13:51] <JimE_zOS> my HS was ahead of most by offering programming classes in the early 80s
[08/09 13:51] <02charlie> ALWAYS helps to have a mentor, no matter what you're trying to do
[08/09 13:51] <triveni> cool.. even my HS course was kind of advanced..
[08/09 13:52] <triveni> Yeah luckily all my mentors were always good
[08/09 13:52] <triveni> and I can say that even now 
[08/09 13:52] <JimE_zOS> until now :-)
[08/09 13:52] <triveni> :D
[08/09 13:52] <triveni> hahaha
[08/09 13:52] <02charlie> lol
[08/09 14:00] <02charlie> brb
[08/09 14:11] <triveni> Jim my member is ready..
[08/09 14:12] <triveni> UBANPTX.ISPF.JCLLIB(NWRK)
[08/09 14:12] <triveni> just look at it..wen u get chance..
[08/09 14:12] <triveni> it has 16 datasets
[08/09 14:12] <triveni> for cluster 1
[08/09 14:12] <triveni> when u ll say, only then i ll submit the test run.
[08/09 14:34] <JimE_zOS> looking
[08/09 14:34] <JimE_zOS> (sorry...off provisioning accounts)
[08/09 14:36] <JimE_zOS> k...I'm satisfied that your job won't hurt anything.  It isn't going to work, but it won't hurt. 
[08/09 14:36] <JimE_zOS> so, by all means, run it so we can start to fix things. 
[08/09 14:37] <triveni> hhaha
[08/09 14:38] <triveni> it isn't going to run..but run it..
[08/09 14:38] <triveni> ok
[08/09 14:40] <triveni> job cancelled
[08/09 14:40] <triveni> it didnt give me that volume
[08/09 14:40] <triveni> i think so
[08/09 14:40] <triveni> UBANPTXL J122077
[08/09 14:41] <triveni> UNABLE TO ALLOCATE 1 UNIT(S)  
[08/09 14:41] <triveni> should i change anything in UNIT=3390 parameter
[08/09 14:42] <triveni> or something else needs to be done ?
[08/09 14:45] <JimE_zOS> yeah....couple of things. 
[08/09 14:45] <JimE_zOS> first, where did the job run? 
[08/09 14:45] <triveni> sysc
[08/09 14:45] <triveni> check it in tsoc
[08/09 14:45] <JimE_zOS> is that what you wanted? 
[08/09 14:45] <triveni> its a test run
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> so i just was not focused on where it should run
[08/09 14:46] <JimE_zOS> yeah, it was.  A test run to build CLUSTER 1 NWKR datasets. 
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> i can add the route commands
[08/09 14:46] <JimE_zOS> and since CLUSTER 1 volumes aren't online to the internal cluster, unlikely to work. 
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> to make sure it runs in particular system
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> ohh
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> i can change msgclass
[08/09 14:46] <JimE_zOS> second....how many characters in a VOLSER? 
[08/09 14:46] <triveni> that ll work
[08/09 14:47] <JimE_zOS> MSGCLASS has nothing to do with job routing, so not likely our problem. 
[08/09 14:47] <JimE_zOS> ROUTE cards would be good. 
[08/09 14:47] <JimE_zOS> and you need to check your VOLSERs
[08/09 14:47] <triveni> L19PA
[08/09 14:48] <JimE_zOS> how many characters is that? 
[08/09 14:48] <JimE_zOS> how many characters in a VOLSER? 
[08/09 14:49] <triveni> it should be 6
[08/09 14:49] <triveni> i guess
[08/09 14:49] <JimE_zOS> and how many do you have? 
[08/09 14:49] <triveni> 5
[08/09 14:49] <JimE_zOS> and therein is the problem. 
[08/09 14:50] <triveni> i can make it 6
[08/09 14:50] <JimE_zOS> LEXIS uses most of the characters in a VOLSER to know what to do with teh volume. 
[08/09 14:50] <JimE_zOS> so the characters need to all be there and they need to be correct. 
[08/09 14:50] <JimE_zOS> or LEXIS will have a fit. 
[08/09 14:50] <triveni> ok
[08/09 14:50] <triveni> lemme correct it
[08/09 14:51] <triveni> and i ll add route card for cluster 1
[08/09 14:51] <JimE_zOS> one such example happened at a BCP long ago. 
[08/09 14:51] <JimE_zOS> the VOLSER told LEXIS the volume was a 3380 but at BCP it was actually a 3390.  Much sadness. 
[08/09 14:51] <triveni> ohh ok
[08/09 14:51] <triveni> can i change unit to disk
[08/09 14:52] <triveni> will dat be a good idea
[08/09 14:52] <JimE_zOS> I suggest UNIT=SYSALLDA 
[08/09 14:52] <triveni> ok
[08/09 14:52] <JimE_zOS> but LEXIS will still look at teh VOLSER to determine things about the volume. 
[08/09 14:53] <JimE_zOS> so the VOLSER still has to be correct. 
[08/09 14:53] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 14:54] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/09 14:56] <triveni> /*ROUTE XEQ DCI
[08/09 14:56] <triveni> /*ROUTE PRINT DCI
[08/09 14:56] <triveni> can i add this
[08/09 14:56] <triveni> for cluster 1
[08/09 14:57] <JimE_zOS> you can.....but I wouldn't do that exactly 
[08/09 14:57] <JimE_zOS> the ROUTE XEQ card is fine. 
[08/09 14:57] <triveni> /*ROUTE XEQ DCI
[08/09 14:57] <triveni> /*ROUTE PRINT DCC
[08/09 14:57] <triveni> will this be good
[08/09 14:57] <JimE_zOS> but it is generally nicer to have the job route back to the internal cluster. 
[08/09 14:57] <triveni> ok
[08/09 14:57] <JimE_zOS> yep....better 
[08/09 14:59] <triveni> ran with rc+0
[08/09 14:59] <triveni> rc=0
[08/09 14:59] <JimE_zOS> k...good. 
[08/09 15:00] <triveni> PZ00.LPASA.LN19PA.NWRK00
[08/09 15:00] <triveni> yup created
[08/09 15:00] <triveni> all 16
[08/09 15:00] <JimE_zOS> k....let's talk about the DSN. 
[08/09 15:00] <triveni> u can check it in sysI
[08/09 15:00] <triveni> its info is dere
[08/09 15:00] <JimE_zOS> I know I glossed over teh DSN, but someplace in there we need to have a copy number. 
[08/09 15:01] <JimE_zOS> not so much for LEXIS, but for us. 
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> ohh
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:01] <JimE_zOS> otherwise we can't allocate more than one dataset per volume
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> yeah
[08/09 15:01] <JimE_zOS> if you run that job again, it will fail. 
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> should i delete them
[08/09 15:01] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> will i be able to delete them now
[08/09 15:01] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:02] <JimE_zOS> if you can allocate a dataset, you can delete it. 
[08/09 15:02] <JimE_zOS> both take ALTER level RACF authority 
[08/09 15:02] <triveni> cool
[08/09 15:02] <triveni> i deleted all of them
[08/09 15:02] <triveni> well job is working that's good
[08/09 15:02] <JimE_zOS> k....so let's enhance your JCL to include a copy number
[08/09 15:02] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:03] <06Amit_zOS> already working on such enhancements
[08/09 15:07] <triveni>  m keeping names like this 
[08/09 15:07] <triveni> PZ00.LPASA.LN19PA.NWRK00.C10
[08/09 15:07] <triveni> and for the copies which can switch.. i ll use PZ01
[08/09 15:08] <triveni> they will have two datasets pz00 and pz01 for the same copy
[08/09 15:09] <JimE_zOS> couple of things 
[08/09 15:09] <JimE_zOS> first, LPASA is an internal cluster dataset name. 
[08/09 15:09] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:09] <triveni> i ll change that
[08/09 15:10] <JimE_zOS> second, as a matter of style, we don't generally include the VOLSER in a dataset name for anything but the SA CWRK datasets. 
[08/09 15:10] <JimE_zOS> also as a matter of style, we usually use "CP" rather than just "C" to denote a copy specific dataset. 
[08/09 15:11] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:11] <JimE_zOS> logistically, it is really nice if you can enter a 3.4 search and find all of something. 
[08/09 15:11] <triveni> PZ00.PROD1.PROD.CP10.NWRK00
[08/09 15:12] <JimE_zOS> so if I wanted to find all of the copy 10 NWKR datasets, that would be harder to do with the DSN above because copy is clear at the end. 
[08/09 15:12] <JimE_zOS> yeah....better
[08/09 15:12] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:13] <06Amit_zOS> i was thinking if it might help if we put a 'B' as a prefix for 'CPxx' since we are allocating two sets of nworks 
[08/09 15:14] <06Amit_zOS> B as in background
[08/09 15:14] <JimE_zOS> I'm still fighting with myself over that point, Amit. 
[08/09 15:14] <JimE_zOS> if you want to at this stage, fine. 
[08/09 15:14] <JimE_zOS> I'd suggest BG or FG, however. 
[08/09 15:14] <JimE_zOS> more recognizable. 
[08/09 15:15] <JimE_zOS> at least to us. 
[08/09 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[08/09 15:15] <triveni> CPBG14
[08/09 15:15] <triveni> BGCP14
[08/09 15:15] <triveni> something like that
[08/09 15:15] <triveni> i ll add
[08/09 15:15] <JimE_zOS> let's make it a separate node in teh dataset name 
[08/09 15:16] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[08/09 15:16] <JimE_zOS> like PZ00.PROD1.PROD.CP10.FG.NWRK00 
[08/09 15:16] <triveni> BG.CP14
[08/09 15:16] <JimE_zOS> something like that, yes
[08/09 15:16] <JimE_zOS> we'll debate the order later. 
[08/09 15:16] <triveni> ok urs
[08/09 15:17] <JimE_zOS> still considering the details. 
[08/09 15:19] <JimE_zOS> I've tried a number of times to improve the naming standards.  Some parts of the newer names I like, and some part I don't. 
[08/09 15:20] <JimE_zOS> so I'm considering a modification 
[08/09 15:20] <triveni> anyways we are using FG and BG for distinction
[08/09 15:20] <triveni> so should i use PZ01 or not
[08/09 15:20] <triveni> i thought earlier that will be the main distinction
[08/09 15:20] <JimE_zOS> sure....PZ00 or PZ01.....not really what I'm talking about. 
[08/09 15:21] <JimE_zOS> we are just getting UR JCL to work. 
[08/09 15:21] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:21] <JimE_zOS> we'll zero in on the final dataset names later
[08/09 15:21] <JimE_zOS> after I argue with myself some more. 
[08/09 15:22] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:22] <triveni> i ll use PZ01 for now.. and test it.. it will make sure.. PZ01 qualifiers are functional atleast..
[08/09 15:24] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[08/09 15:25] <JimE_zOS> and we are going to create and delete these test datasets a number of times during development. 
[08/09 15:25] <triveni> ok
[08/09 15:40] <JimE_zOS> so are we at the point where we can allocate both FG and BG sized NWRK datasets for a single copy? 
[08/09 15:42] <06Amit_zOS> i am having trouble with the operation fields
[08/09 15:42] <06Amit_zOS> (setting variables)
[08/09 15:42] <JimE_zOS> want to share an error message 
[08/09 15:42] <triveni> am just decorating them
[08/09 15:42] <JimE_zOS> or should I look at your job? 
[08/09 15:42] <JimE_zOS> decorating? 
[08/09 15:42] <06Amit_zOS>  UNENMAXN J171208
[08/09 15:43] <JimE_zOS> the SR doesn't like lace. :-)
[08/09 15:43] <JimE_zOS> looking
[08/09 15:43] <triveni> i mean jsut correcting the names hehehe 
[08/09 15:44] <JimE_zOS> missing comma at the end, Amit 
[08/09 15:44] <JimE_zOS> sorry...irc ate my paste. 
[08/09 15:44] <JimE_zOS> SPACE=(TRK,(&PRIMARY),,CONTIG)  
[08/09 15:44] <JimE_zOS> need a comma at the end of this line. 
[08/09 15:45] <JimE_zOS> without it, JES thinks the next line is a new JCL statement. 
[08/09 15:45] <JimE_zOS> and it isn't....it is a continuation of the DD 
[08/09 15:46] <06Amit_zOS> wonderful
[08/09 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> does the statement no. help locate where the comma was missing
[08/09 15:50] <06Amit_zOS> ?
[08/09 15:52] <JimE_zOS> it does. 
[08/09 15:52] <JimE_zOS> I used the statement number as the starting point of my JCL read. 
[08/09 15:53] <JimE_zOS> when I saw that the statement number pointed to a fragment of a DD statement, I suspected missing continuation. 
[08/09 15:53] <06Amit_zOS> statement no is the same as line number is it?
[08/09 15:54] <06Amit_zOS> now my job ran fine
[08/09 15:54] <06Amit_zOS> but i dont see the datasets
[08/09 15:54] <06Amit_zOS> UNENMAXN J182122
[08/09 15:56] <JimE_zOS> looking
[08/09 15:56] <triveni> UBANPTXL J183435
[08/09 15:57] <JimE_zOS> I see them, Amit. 
[08/09 15:57] <JimE_zOS> from Cluster 2, of course. 
[08/09 15:58] <06Amit_zOS> oh do i need to login to cl2 to see them on 3.4?
[08/09 15:58] <triveni> dont see mine
[08/09 15:58] <triveni> wait
[08/09 15:58] <triveni> it worked
[08/09 15:58] <triveni> but one dsn name doesnt look good
[08/09 15:58] <JimE_zOS> and for teh BG allocations, I think you are missing a period
[08/09 15:58] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.PROD1.PROD.BCP21.BG.NWRK00
[08/09 15:59] <JimE_zOS> oh, well, I guess you have an extra "B" in the name. 
[08/09 15:59] <06Amit_zOS> yup i saw that
[08/09 16:00] <JimE_zOS> now looking at Triveni's job/datasets 
[08/09 16:01] <JimE_zOS> in Triveni's case: "DUPLICATE NAME ON DIRECT ACCESS VOLUME" 
[08/09 16:01] <triveni> UBANPTXL J186127
[08/09 16:01] <JimE_zOS> so I'd guess incomplete clean-up between runs. 
[08/09 16:01] <triveni> this ran good
[08/09 16:01] <triveni> no 
[08/09 16:01] <triveni> something fishy
[08/09 16:02] <JimE_zOS> JOBNAME--JOBID---ACT-STAT-
[08/09 16:02] <JimE_zOS> UBANPTXL J186127     JCL  
[08/09 16:02] <triveni> it ll b something stupid
[08/09 16:02] <triveni> check the latest time
[08/09 16:02] <JimE_zOS> duplicate dataset name....incomplete clean-up between runs. 
[08/09 16:02] <JimE_zOS> is there an echo in here? :-)
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> check my jcl
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> i think its good
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> i should just wait and then run
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> i guess
[08/09 16:03] <JimE_zOS> the JCL isn't the issue....the datasets already on the volume are teh issue. 
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> ohh
[08/09 16:03] <triveni> ok
[08/09 16:04] <06Amit_zOS> ok, nwrks for copy 21 looking good Jim?
[08/09 16:04] <06Amit_zOS> any changes required?
[08/09 16:04] <triveni> jim isn't it good to add a delete step in the beginning of job
[08/09 16:04] <triveni> so that we know its going to be a clean run
[08/09 16:06] <triveni> coz i deleted them with "d"
[08/09 16:06] <06Amit_zOS> so did i.. that should work
[08/09 16:06] <JimE_zOS> for normal dataset allocation, I'd say yes, Triveni. 
[08/09 16:06] <triveni> but nworks no
[08/09 16:06] <triveni> right
[08/09 16:07] <JimE_zOS> but do you really want to add a delete step(s) for 32 datasets? 
[08/09 16:07] <JimE_zOS> you are welcome to do so and UR right....it'll help ensure a clean run. 
[08/09 16:11] <06Amit_zOS> assuming the files we are generating are good, we wait till we land on a good naming convention in order to create all the nworks for the switch hitters right? 
[08/09 16:12] <JimE_zOS> sure...true 
[08/09 16:13] <06Amit_zOS> i
[08/09 16:13] <06Amit_zOS> is there a difference between recfm f and fb?
[08/09 16:14] <JimE_zOS> there is, yes. 
[08/09 16:14] <JimE_zOS> FB means the dataset has a blocking factor. 
[08/09 16:14] <06Amit_zOS> I see
[08/09 16:14] <JimE_zOS> that controls how many chunks of space we allocate per track 
[08/09 16:14] <06Amit_zOS> and f is continuous
[08/09 16:14] <06Amit_zOS> ?
[08/09 16:15] <triveni>  please check mine Jim..
[08/09 16:15] <JimE_zOS> generally, you want to stuff the track as full as you can. 
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> its the same issue
[08/09 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> what's wrong.. probably something silly
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> i deleted and ran it
[08/09 16:15] <JimE_zOS> "F" means no blocking factor 
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> but its the same
[08/09 16:15] <JimE_zOS> looking
[08/09 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> gotcha
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> UBANPTXM J196548
[08/09 16:15] <JimE_zOS> what error message did you get? 
[08/09 16:15] <triveni> jcl
[08/09 16:16] <triveni> it created two datasets
[08/09 16:16] <triveni> and failed
[08/09 16:16] <JimE_zOS> yeah.....but what error message (not what error type) 
[08/09 16:16] <triveni> DUPLICATE NAME ON DIRECT ACCESS VOLUME
[08/09 16:17] <JimE_zOS> so a trip to that volume might be helpful.

[08/09 16:17] <triveni> ok
[08/09 16:18] <triveni> how can i check it
[08/09 16:18] <triveni> i checked jcl that's all
[08/09 16:18] <JimE_zOS> use the force :-)
[08/09 16:18] <triveni> force
[08/09 16:18] <JimE_zOS> use 3.4 and enter the VOLSER with no dataset name. 
[08/09 16:19] <triveni> ok
[08/09 16:19] <triveni> got it
[08/09 16:19] <triveni> thanks jim
[08/09 16:20] <JimE_zOS> don't thank me...you found the problme. 
[08/09 16:20] <JimE_zOS> problem, even 
[08/09 16:20] <triveni> understood what went wrong
[08/09 16:20] <triveni> :)
[08/09 16:21] <06Amit_zOS> and when i try to login to tsoi, i get :LOGON FAILED JCL ERROR IN LOGON PROCEDURE
[08/09 16:21] <JimE_zOS> as this demo shows, it is a lot of work to build functional JCL. 
[08/09 16:21] <JimE_zOS> interesting. 
[08/09 16:21] <JimE_zOS> looking. 
[08/09 16:21] <JimE_zOS> gotta put my security hat on first. 
[08/09 16:22] <06Amit_zOS> $TSODUSF-- this is the procedure i use
[08/09 16:22] <triveni>  ran clean
[08/09 16:22] <triveni> UBANPTXM J203238
[08/09 16:23] <triveni> check the datasets on cluster 1 jim
[08/09 16:23] <JimE_zOS> yeah...which doesn't exist on the external cluster. 
[08/09 16:24] <JimE_zOS> you changed it from $TSOISPF....and you probably shouldn't have. 
[08/09 16:24] <JimE_zOS> sec....I'll fix. 
[08/09 16:24] <06Amit_zOS> i dont remember to even logging into tsoi for a long time.. 
[08/09 16:25] <JimE_zOS> k...try logging on now. 
[08/09 16:26] <06Amit_zOS> logged in but i dont have an ispf profile
[08/09 16:26] <JimE_zOS> probably archived
[08/09 16:26] <JimE_zOS> just restore it. 
[08/09 16:26] <JimE_zOS> pick I for immediate 
[08/09 16:26] <JimE_zOS> and Y for wait. 
[08/09 16:27] <JimE_zOS> it only takes a second. 
[08/09 16:27] <06Amit_zOS> its already deffered
[08/09 16:27] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, your TSO PROCs on K, Q, F and teh TDD are all fine. 
[08/09 16:28] <JimE_zOS> then you have to wait. 
[08/09 16:28] <JimE_zOS> not sure how long that takes. 
[08/09 16:28] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/09 16:29] <triveni> and now my datasets Jim..
[08/09 16:29] <triveni> :)
[08/09 16:29] <triveni> do they look pretty.. i tried decorating them.. ;)
[08/09 16:30] <02charlie> you can TSO SUB ULESTCX.ISPF.JCLLIB(TOUCH) to have it go out and make sure all your profile datasets are not archived
[08/09 16:30] <06Amit_zOS> yes, after this is restored, i'd do that regularly
[08/09 16:31] <dsk_hbe> I'm going to head out.  See you all tomorrow!
[08/09 16:31] * dsk_hbe is now known as dsk_away
[08/09 16:31] <06Amit_zOS> Bye Debbie!
[08/09 16:31] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[08/09 16:31] <02charlie> it uses the sysuid symbol to submit it under your UID and touch your profile datasets, and since you're soung the subbing, it will be correct
[08/09 16:31] <dsk_away> bye!
[08/09 16:31] <02charlie> bye debbie, thx for yur help!
[08/09 16:31] <dsk_away> any time!
[08/09 16:31] <triveni> bye debbie!!

[08/09 16:37] <triveni> you can check mine in cluster 1

[08/09 16:37] <triveni> did u check both jim
[08/09 16:38] <triveni> those which can be switched

[08/09 16:38] <triveni> PZ01.PROD1.PROD.CP18.BG.NWRK14
[08/09 16:38] <JimE_zOS> but copy 11, for example, needs 16 datasets
[08/09 16:38] <triveni> and the rest

[08/09 16:38] <JimE_zOS> and copy 12 needs 16 datasets 
[08/09 16:39] <JimE_zOS> even if we only had one set per copy, there would need to be 160 datsets.
[08/09 16:39] <triveni> i didnt create extra dataset for 10,15, 14 and 19
[08/09 16:39] <triveni> as they will always be fg and bg
[08/09 16:39] <JimE_zOS> you didn't even create a single set of dataset for one copy 
[08/09 16:39] <triveni> and created two datasets for 11,12,13,16,17,18
[08/09 16:39] <JimE_zOS> stop. 
[08/09 16:39] <triveni> ok
[08/09 16:40] <triveni> i ll listen
[08/09 16:40] <JimE_zOS> I should be able to find 16 datasets for CP10. 
[08/09 16:40] <JimE_zOS> I don't.  I find one dataset. 
[08/09 16:40] <triveni> i got ur point jim
[08/09 16:40] <JimE_zOS> k
[08/09 16:40] <triveni> understood v clearly
[08/09 16:41] <06Amit_zOS> And nwrks for cpy 21 look good?
[08/09 16:45] <JimE_zOS> I think so, Amit, yes
[08/09 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> and do you want me to create it for the rest of the switch hitters just yet?
[08/09 16:46] <JimE_zOS> nah....just wanted to get teh JCL functional today 
[08/09 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/09 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> Thnx
[08/09 16:46] <JimE_zOS> let me finish the internal arguement before we do more. 
[08/09 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> i will crossover then
[08/09 16:46] <JimE_zOS> I want to make sure Triveni has good JCL too. 
[08/09 16:47] <JimE_zOS> yes, sure...by all means. 
[08/09 16:48] <triveni> working on it
[08/09 16:49] <JimE_zOS> no hurry....I want you to understand.  That is the important part. 
[08/09 16:50] <JimE_zOS> and it is getting late.  if we need to pick this up in the morning, that is fine too.

[08/09 17:09] <JimE_zOS> it isn't normal to put all of the NWRKs for a single copy on a single volume. 
[08/09 17:09] <06Amit_ZOS> you are storing all extents in the same volume
[08/09 17:09] <JimE_zOS> jinx! 
[08/09 17:09] <triveni> yup
[08/09 17:09] <triveni> i ll change
[08/09 17:10] <06Amit_ZOS> 16 extents in 16 volumes
[08/09 17:10] <06Amit_ZOS> ranging from LN19PA to LN19PP
[08/09 17:11] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, out of curiousity, what were you upto untill 6 30 yesterday in office!? SOoooooo much work?

[08/10 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> she just got to office
[08/10 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> the first quit was when she left her home wifi/vpn
[08/10 09:53] <dsk_hbe> ah ok... maybe that explains it.  the bounces were making me dizzy ;-)
[08/10 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> second was when she got the office wifi/vpn

[08/10 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> and third is when she docked her laptop

[08/10 10:55] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Jim!
[08/10 10:58] <dsk_hbe> can someone remind me what the text in a dummy doc looks like?  I can't seem to recall
[08/10 10:58] <JimE_zOS> thinking. 
[08/10 10:59] <JimE_zOS> I keep wanting to type the ADF string...which isn't what you want 
[08/10 10:59] <JimE_zOS> Charlie knows....
[08/10 10:59] <JimE_zOS> he's walking to IRC now.

[08/10 11:01] <JimE_zOS> guess what is missing from this morning?  Yep....splash of coffee.  BRB

[08/10 11:05] <02charlie> the Y abends mean that we pulled a DB out from under someone while they were using it
[08/10 11:05] <06Amit_ZOS> 010634 15ZZ WARMSTART WARNING - LS190D MONITOR.N110 - WRONG CPU CODE
[08/10 11:05] <06Amit_ZOS> i think me and Jim had seen this before once in the diary..
[08/10 11:06] <06Amit_ZOS> (this is from yesterday)
[08/10 11:09] <triveni> hi jim
[08/10 11:10] <06Amit_ZOS> there were 34 warmstart warnings yesterday..
[08/10 11:11] <dsk_hbe> yikes
[08/10 11:11] <02charlie> dont know why the warmstart warning came out, but that copy came down normally at 0050, and then came back up at 0106
[08/10 11:11] <dsk_hbe> oh, not for prod?
[08/10 11:11] <06Amit_ZOS> YES PROD
[08/10 11:11] <06Amit_ZOS> PE00.LPAED.DIARY.DAILY
[08/10 11:11] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... not seeign it in the online stat, weird
[08/10 11:11] <02charlie> and there were no warmstarts, so there must be something hinky about how the bridge copies come back up
[08/10 11:12] <06Amit_ZOS> all of them were warnings
[08/10 11:12] <06Amit_ZOS> not warmstarts themselves
[08/10 11:12] <06Amit_ZOS> and it was because of a wrong cpu code
[08/10 11:12] <02charlie> and all of them were probably on bridge copies
[08/10 11:12] <02charlie> im guessing
[08/10 11:12] <dsk_hbe> oh, these are just an anomaly that happens sometimes, especially when copies are changing from prod to bridge
[08/10 11:13] <dsk_hbe> non-issue, Amit
[08/10 11:13] <06Amit_ZOS> understood..
[08/10 11:13] <02charlie> i would have to go chase the XMLFMT abend down, but there was only one and they happen occassionally
[08/10 11:14] <06Amit_ZOS> yes, i was not tooo alrmed by these because i remembr talking about this with jim over a month ago and he also told me it was a 'non-issue'
[08/10 11:16] <06Amit_ZOS> and there was some 'menu name unknown' message but was on an sa copy '01' so ignoring that 
[08/10 11:18] <JimE_zOS> back 
[08/10 11:20] <06Amit_ZOS> also SROPTM+0001E is new right?
[08/10 11:20] <02charlie> oh, this document has many problems:
[08/10 11:20] <02charlie> LNI-INDIVIDUAL FIELDS TIME STAMP   ASSIGNMENT IDEN   PARTITION #   SEQUENCE #   ATTACHMENT #   OBJECT TYPE   PART #
[08/10 11:20] <02charlie>                  2039-08-20/11:14:43     8             0062502       0150          0000            0         00    
[08/10 11:22] <02charlie> not new, but infrequent, we had 6 on 4/6
[08/10 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[08/10 11:32] <JimE_zOS> change approved to move NWRK datasets this weekend, BTW 
[08/10 11:32] <triveni> cool
[08/10 11:32] <triveni> so its ready for this weekend?
[08/10 11:32] <triveni> yey
[08/10 11:32] <JimE_zOS> the change request is in and approved. 
[08/10 11:33] <JimE_zOS> our prep work, however, is not complete. 
[08/10 11:33] <triveni> tell us wen to start the rest of the work
[08/10 11:33] <triveni> yeah 
[08/10 11:33] <JimE_zOS> fear not, Grasshopper, I'll let you know. 
[08/10 11:33] <triveni> :D
[08/10 11:33] <02charlie> i'm not sure they're old enough to get the reference, jim :D
[08/10 11:35] <02charlie> i was just happy some of the people on ss got my rodney dangerfield reference yesterday :D
[08/10 11:35] <triveni> ;)
[08/10 11:42] <JimE_zOS> I'll explain the "Grasshopper" reference in person.
[08/10 11:42] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Mike K. 
[08/10 11:42] <JimE_zOS> I need to finish up my DSN thoughts.  
[08/10 11:42] <JimE_zOS> so stepping away to do so. 
[08/10 11:42] <triveni> ok

[08/10 13:36] <06Amit_zOS> back
[08/10 13:39] <02charlie> oh, and amit, the XMLFMT error is LSA, and means it couldnt render a table in classic, which means probably one of my problem children is doing their stuff in prod again instead of fabc
[08/10 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/10 13:40] <06Amit_zOS> settled on the DSN Jim?
[08/10 14:05] <JimE_zOS> I think I have. 
[08/10 14:05] <06Amit_zOS> wonderful
[08/10 14:05] <JimE_zOS> which we'll discuss after staff mtg. 
[08/10 14:05] <06Amit_zOS> sure
[08/10 14:05] <JimE_zOS> I have 11CR155 reserved 
[08/10 14:05] <triveni> cool
[08/10 14:06] <JimE_zOS> mostly I like the new naming scheme 
[08/10 14:06] <JimE_zOS> but I need a text string that means OLS prod w/out using the word "PROD" 
[08/10 14:06] <JimE_zOS> I was thinking "CUST" 
[08/10 14:06] <JimE_zOS> thoughts? 
[08/10 14:07] <06Amit_zOS> CUST is good
[08/10 14:07] <06Amit_zOS> LIVE is also good
[08/10 14:08] <triveni> OLS
[08/10 14:08] <triveni> ;)
[08/10 14:08] <dsk_hbe> I'm good with whatever you guys settle on... is the need here for in case we have to backout?  so we're holding the current stuff just in case?
[08/10 14:09] <JimE_zOS> we'll hold the current stuff, yes. 
[08/10 14:09] <JimE_zOS> but the name change has greater reach . 
[08/10 14:09] <JimE_zOS> it is part of the "better bridge" and "automated metadata fallback" ideas I'm working. 
[08/10 14:10] <dsk_hbe> well I just know I'm gonna like that :-)
[08/10 14:10] <JimE_zOS> ie, PL00.CUST (or whatever) will start to become a common name everywhere.
[08/10 14:10] <JimE_zOS> I think our names need to be something like this: 
[08/10 14:11] <JimE_zOS> HLQ | OLS Name | Configuration | Status | Resource 
[08/10 14:11] <JimE_zOS> so something like: PL00.CUST.DAY.PROD.CPxx etc 
[08/10 14:12] <JimE_zOS> or PL00.CUST.NITE.PROD.CLxx etc. 
[08/10 14:12] <JimE_zOS> day and nite represent the expanded role of the old bridge tech. 
[08/10 14:12] <dsk_hbe> gotcha.  as long as the ols accomodates the difference, I am good with whatever you choose.  You are the idea man
[08/10 14:12] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, Amit, I did consider "LIVE" 
[08/10 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> You can see the matrix
[08/10 14:13] <JimE_zOS> the only sticking point, I think, will be the monitor utilities. 
[08/10 14:13] <JimE_zOS> they are pretty close minded about dataset names. 
[08/10 14:14] <JimE_zOS> which just means I should hurry up and replace them with teh C1 stuff I developed. 
[08/10 14:14] <06Amit_zOS> monitor utilities meaning the tools we use to check them?
[08/10 14:15] <JimE_zOS> meaning the tools we use to manipulate them.  
[08/10 14:15] <JimE_zOS> allocate them (LXALDS), unload them, change their status, etc 
[08/10 14:15] <06Amit_zOS> got it
[08/10 14:16] <JimE_zOS> LXALDS and unload aren't interested in what I think about names. 
[08/10 14:16] <JimE_zOS> MONUTL is a little more forgiving. 
[08/10 14:17] <triveni> ok
[08/10 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> so jim, are we no longer planning to change the HLQ? do we now just change the | Status | part of it?
[08/10 14:19] <06Amit_zOS> as in not changing pl00 to pz00
[08/10 14:19] <JimE_zOS> I think we'll still use the HLQ because that is the best way to ensure LEXIS doesn't look 
[08/10 14:19] <JimE_zOS> any PL00 dataset is fair game for LEXIS. 
[08/10 14:20] <JimE_zOS> and I want to make sure he doesn't even look at the datasets that aren't for current use. 
[08/10 14:20] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/10 14:20] <06Amit_zOS> more q's during discussion

[08/10 17:25] <triveni_away> bye!!
[08/10 17:30] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, your tso pwd gets revoked only if you try 3 or more times in the same session right?
[08/10 17:31] * triveni_away has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 363 seconds)
[08/10 18:16] <06Amit_ZOS> question to anyone: symbols can be used in instream control cards right?
[08/10 18:16] <06Amit_ZOS> (after sysin dd *)
[08/10 18:16] <02charlie> you need to use the right options
[08/10 18:16] <02charlie> sec
[08/10 18:17] <02charlie> you need this statement in your JCL, i put it at the front after the route and jobparm cards
[08/10 18:17] <02charlie> //        EXPORT SYMLIST=* 
[08/10 18:18] <02charlie> and then you need DD *,SYMBOLS=<valid option>. In my jobs, I use DD *,SYMBOLS=EXECSYS  EXECSYS  
[08/10 18:18] <02charlie> let me retype that
[08/10 18:18] <02charlie> and then you need DD *,SYMBOLS=<valid option>. In my jobs, I use DD *,SYMBOLS=EXECSYS   
[08/10 18:18] <06Amit_ZOS> SYMBOLS=JCLONLY should work right?
[08/10 18:19] <02charlie> yes, but then i dont think you can use system symbols, like &SYSUID
[08/10 18:19] <02charlie> since i tend to use both JCL and system symbols in mine, i use the EXECSYS
[08/10 18:19] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/10 18:19] <06Amit_ZOS> gotch
[08/10 18:20] <06Amit_ZOS> gotcha
[08/10 18:20] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks! will try now
[08/10 18:27] <02charlie> ok. i'm going to pack up, head to ops, then leave

[08/11 12:13] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/11 12:13] <02charlie> chpgs is what i thought you've discussed before
[08/11 12:13] <dsk_hbe> sorry... I did that to you... I was thinking one thing and lookign for it but if you meant promotes for sure then I need to look for something else ;-)
[08/11 12:14] <02charlie> promotes
[08/11 12:14] <02charlie> that would be the chpgs right?
[08/11 12:14] <dsk_hbe> MKUNs are down a lot due to the machine Briggs governs going out to lunch.  so we get a backlog of data that needs scratched and it causes the metaset cache errors
[08/11 12:14] <02charlie> ah
[08/11 12:14] <dsk_hbe> but now I'll look for promotes ;-)
[08/11 12:16] <dsk_hbe> listing as I find them... 3/21, Jim had this ticket - INC01134325
[08/11 12:17] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... thatis a 2016 ticket... something is amock here... but that's an example for you, old though it is ;-)
[08/11 12:21] <dsk_hbe> ah it is getting clearer now... I bet the occurrences you were remembering were when we were taking the eclipse abends.  used to be prior to eclipse we turned off promtoes and after we turned it back on.  with the abends we were leaving promotes turned off and had to manually turn them back on.  WE decided with only internals using SA eclipse now, we coudl stop turnign it off so Doug made the changes to accomodate that.
[08/11 12:21] <dsk_hbe> Let me find the dates in case it will tie to your oncall issue
[08/11 12:21] <02charlie> ah, yes, i think that might have been the discussion
[08/11 12:22] <dsk_hbe> looks like around 6/8 that was done... which is still before my 6/11 release when I did not have the same issue you did during your release
[08/11 12:25] <dsk_hbe> and actually it was Scott who made the change to automation to accomodate that
[08/11 12:27] <02charlie> thx
[08/11 12:27] <dsk_hbe> sure hting
[08/11 12:34] <02charlie> and Eclipse is using the SDI switch to control the promotes, not the special resource, right?
[08/11 12:35] <dsk_hbe> I wanna say the special resource, sec, I'll just forward you the email from Scott after I find it again ;-)
[08/11 12:36] <dsk_hbe> and it was Tom Erwin... man, my memory sucks ;-)

[08/11 13:19] <02charlie> pls do

[08/11 13:20] <02charlie> lol
[08/11 13:20] <02charlie> i know tom put the automation in on 6/8, but ops may not have relied upon that until later
[08/11 13:22] <dsk_hbe> but all they woudl have done is turn it back on... so unless its one of those flip it and you get the other option switches, I'm not sure that happened... but I will find out ;-)
[08/11 13:23] <02charlie> there's other puzzling aspects about that also, but it feels like peeling an onion

[08/11 14:39] <dsk_hbe> ah, the Sunday morning piece... ok, I'm cool then.  I'm sure Jim wants to figure out why the right arrival time isn't happening still though.
[08/11 14:43] <02charlie> yeah. i'm wondering if it might be this piece on operation 120: Time dependent         : No

[08/11 23:59] <triveni> Hey Jim!!
[08/11 23:59] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Triveni. 
[08/11 23:59] <JimE_zOS> UR way, way, early 
[08/11 23:59] <triveni> How does everything look so far..
[08/11 23:59] <JimE_zOS> I think fine. 
[08/11 23:59] <triveni> Just wanted to see..if anything needs help
[08/11 23:59] <JimE_zOS> I'm here to make final checks
[08/11 23:59] <triveni> ok..I know i can count on ur word
[08/11 23:59] <triveni> :D
[08/11 23:59] <triveni> ok
Session Time: Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 2017
[08/12 00:00] <triveni> m here.. lemme know if u need me.
[08/12 00:00] <JimE_zOS> k
[08/12 00:00] <JimE_zOS> I'm just going to look at some things but I don't expect to do much 
[08/12 00:02] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/12 00:02] <Amit_away> Hello Jim!
[08/12 00:02] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/12 00:03] <06Amit_zOS> are the fcard prep job ready (as in submitted)?
[08/12 00:03] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Amit. 
[08/12 00:03] <JimE_zOS> yes, I have run the F-Card job. 
[08/12 00:04] <triveni> yeah i saw it in spool
[08/12 00:05] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/12 00:12] <06Amit_zOS> how about our rename jobs? do we need to test them?  Did you want to look at them?
[08/12 00:12] <06Amit_zOS> (test them again)
[08/12 00:12] <JimE_zOS> I thought the rename JCL was mine to do?  
[08/12 00:12] <JimE_zOS> (and I'm done) 
[08/12 00:13] <JimE_zOS> did I misunderstand? 
[08/12 00:13] <triveni> I thought the same Jim
[08/12 00:13] <triveni> that u r doing it
[08/12 00:13] <JimE_zOS> and, FWIW, I've already tested. 
[08/12 00:14] <06Amit_zOS> you were doing the rename of the current nworks to pz01 right?
[08/12 00:15] <JimE_zOS> yes, true 
[08/12 00:15] <JimE_zOS> PL00 -> PZ01, PZ00 -> PL00 
[08/12 00:15] <06Amit_zOS> and I will be renaming the cluster 2 pz00->Pl00 right?
[08/12 00:16] <06Amit_zOS> *PZ00->PL00
[08/12 00:16] <JimE_zOS> I have JCL for all renames. 
[08/12 00:16] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[08/12 00:16] <JimE_zOS> which you are welcome to run for Cluster 2 
[08/12 00:16] <JimE_zOS> for that matter, you can run your own JCL too.  Doesn't matter to me. 
[08/12 00:17] <JimE_zOS> I only offered to supply the JCL because I knew you have Anita training and your afternoon was booked. 
[08/12 00:18] <JimE_zOS> you had Anita training, past tense. 
[08/12 00:18] <06Amit_zOS> okay, i thought I was doing everyhing for cl2... but anyway 
[08/12 00:18] <JimE_zOS> by my guest. 
[08/12 00:18] <06Amit_zOS> oh I still did make the JCL last night
[08/12 00:18] <06Amit_zOS> (rename jcl)
[08/12 00:18] <JimE_zOS> I offer my JCL as an option 
[08/12 00:18] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/12 00:19] <06Amit_zOS> ok in conclusion, what are our responsibilities for tonight?
[08/12 00:19] <06Amit_zOS> just running the rename jcl's?
[08/12 00:19] <06Amit_zOS> as and when copies are down
[08/12 00:21] <JimE_zOS> checking the status of copies, running rename jobs when appropriate. 
[08/12 00:21] <JimE_zOS> ensuring copies start with new NWRKs. 
[08/12 00:21] <JimE_zOS> diary checks to make sure there are no NWRk issues. 
[08/12 00:22] <JimE_zOS> debugging, as needed. 
[08/12 00:22] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/12 00:22] <JimE_zOS> hadn't you better allocate your dataset?  
[08/12 00:23] <JimE_zOS> as part of my check, I went to look at them and they don't seem to be all there. 
[08/12 00:23] <triveni> i created for cluster 1
[08/12 00:23] <triveni> did u find it Jim
[08/12 00:23] <JimE_zOS> Cluster 1 is fine. 
[08/12 00:23] <JimE_zOS> pending my detailed check. 
[08/12 00:24] <JimE_zOS> I was talking to Amit. 
[08/12 00:26] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/12 00:26] <06Amit_zOS> will allocate
[08/12 00:26] <06Amit_zOS> now
[08/12 00:26] <JimE_zOS> k....I'm going to make my final checks.  Won't be watching closely
[08/12 00:27] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/12 00:52] <06Amit_zOS> Jim.. they are allocated..
[08/12 00:52] <06Amit_zOS> could you check?
[08/12 00:53] <JimE_zOS> I will, yes. 
[08/12 00:53] <JimE_zOS> still looking through FCards.  And I found a typo (mine) 
[08/12 00:53] <06Amit_zOS> osh
[08/12 00:53] <JimE_zOS> so I'll get there, but I don't want to jump around. 
[08/12 00:53] <06Amit_zOS> gosh
[08/12 00:53] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/12 00:54] <JimE_zOS> it would have been good to leave it (for the debugging practice)
[08/12 00:54] <JimE_zOS> better to fix it, I guess. 
[08/12 00:54] <JimE_zOS> we can goof with C1 datasets for practice. 
[08/12 00:54] <JimE_zOS> back to F-Cards. 
[08/12 00:54] <JimE_zOS> which I'll re-run when done. 
[08/12 00:54] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. you play your cards close to the chest don't you!?
[08/12 01:07] <JimE_zOS> k...cards running. 
[08/12 01:08] <JimE_zOS> a brief look at rename JCL to ensure I have all of the test names out. 
[08/12 01:10] <06Amit_zOS> UEVANJR.ISPF.JCLLIB(RENAME) is what you will be using right?
[08/12 01:12] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni, which rename job do you intend to use?
[08/12 01:12] <triveni> jim's
[08/12 01:12] <triveni> :)
[08/12 01:12] <triveni> whenever he ll tell me to run 
[08/12 01:12] <triveni> and for which cluster
[08/12 01:14] <triveni> ok so if i want to run for cluster 1
[08/12 01:14] <triveni> i just have to do jg i
[08/12 01:14] <triveni> i guess
[08/12 01:15] <triveni> that will do for one copy
[08/12 01:15] <triveni> let Jim talk coz i can see that rename member.. its different
[08/12 01:16] <triveni> i ll just wait for his instructions..
[08/12 01:16] <JimE_zOS> nope...don't use that. 
[08/12 01:16] <JimE_zOS> REN$CRE 
[08/12 01:16] <JimE_zOS> REN$SRCH
[08/12 01:16] <triveni> ok
[08/12 01:16] <JimE_zOS> both in the PZ00.SS.CONFIG.FG.TO.BG.JCLLIB 
[08/12 01:17] <JimE_zOS> and, yes, JG I will get you there, Triveni. 
[08/12 01:17] <JimE_zOS> you'll have to set the copy number 
[08/12 01:17] <JimE_zOS> and the type (FG or BG) 
[08/12 01:17] <JimE_zOS> but otherwise, auto-pilot 
[08/12 01:18] <JimE_zOS> k...now to datasets.  
[08/12 01:18] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/12 01:18] <JimE_zOS> since I've already made a quick pass through everything but Cluster 2, I'll start there. 
[08/12 01:19] <06Amit_zOS> excellent
[08/12 01:19] <JimE_zOS> you have different naming schemes, Amit
[08/12 01:19] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP29.BG.NWRK15  
[08/12 01:19] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.PROD1.PROD.CP21.BG.NWRK00      
[08/12 01:20] <JimE_zOS> and you have some of these too: 
[08/12 01:20] <JimE_zOS> PZ01.CUST.DAY.PROD.CP21.BG.NWRK00 
[08/12 01:21] <JimE_zOS> I expect to see 276 datasets, and I only see 244 in Cluster 2 
[08/12 01:23] <JimE_zOS> F-Card rerun was clean, BTW 
[08/12 01:23] <JimE_zOS> while Amit investigates, I'll check Cluster 1 
[08/12 01:25] <06Amit_zOS> no more pz01.*
[08/12 01:26] <triveni> ok
[08/12 01:26] <triveni> i have created only 16 for the copies which we are sure that they will always be fg and bg
[08/12 01:27] <triveni> and for the switch copies i have 32 datasets
[08/12 01:28] <JimE_zOS> yep...I like Cluster 1 
[08/12 01:28] <JimE_zOS> Amit, if I may suggest....
[08/12 01:29] <JimE_zOS> deleting and allocating things, if done out of order, will leave unused space in the middle of our datasets 
[08/12 01:29] <JimE_zOS> so, I wonder if it isn't easier to delete all and start fresh. 
[08/12 01:30] <06Amit_zOS> will delete all and start afresh.. sure.. 
[08/12 01:30] <06Amit_zOS> but we won't need the alternate personality nwrks for switch hitters today right?
[08/12 01:31] <06Amit_zOS> there are 180 PZ00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP29
[08/12 01:31] <06Amit_zOS> PZ00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP29
[08/12 01:31] <06Amit_zOS> PZ00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP29
[08/12 01:32] <06Amit_zOS> disregard the paste
[08/12 01:32] <JimE_zOS> we do need them, yes 
[08/12 01:32] <triveni> yeah we need them amit
[08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> if we don't put them there tonight, we won't be able to change personalities later this month.
[08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> can I further suggest....
[08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> use the JRE member in the FG.TO.BG JCLLIB 
[08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> for FG only copies, type JG K 
[08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> for BG only copies, type JG B 
[08/12 01:34] <JimE_zOS> for copies that need both, type JG K B 
[08/12 01:34] <JimE_zOS> build them in order 
[08/12 01:34] <JimE_zOS> it won't take long at all. 
[08/12 01:35] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 01:35] <triveni> i followed that only
[08/12 01:36] <JimE_zOS> the JRE member is new. 
[08/12 01:36] <JimE_zOS> I used it to build Cluster 3 and 4
[08/12 01:36] <JimE_zOS> I wanted an easier way to do the switch hitter copies. 
[08/12 01:38] <06Amit_zOS> [08/12 01:33] <JimE_zOS> for FG only copies, type JG K -----------this will create both fg and bg if you dont // out a line
[08/12 01:38] <JimE_zOS> not if you use the JRE member. 
[08/12 01:39] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/12 01:39] <triveni> i used ur last member nwrksr..
[08/12 01:39] <triveni> probably JRE is better
[08/12 01:39] <JimE_zOS> try it (don't have to submit) 
[08/12 01:41] <JimE_zOS> did I mislead you? 
[08/12 01:41] <JimE_zOS> working as advertised? 
[08/12 01:43] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I'm watching IOF on SYSQ and SYSF 
[08/12 01:43] <JimE_zOS> waiting for copies to start dropping. 
[08/12 01:43] <JimE_zOS> they haven't started to come down yet, but you might want to get ready 
[08/12 01:44] <JimE_zOS> you still have problems, Amit
[08/12 01:44] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP20.FG.NWRK15  
[08/12 01:44] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.PROD1.PROD.CP21.FG.NWRK10      
[08/12 01:44] <JimE_zOS> I don't want you to panic.   
[08/12 01:44] <JimE_zOS> Do you want me to allocate them? 
[08/12 01:45] <06Amit_zOS> creating the datasets
[08/12 01:46] <triveni> i ll monitor sysi copies
[08/12 01:47] <triveni> all are active right now
[08/12 01:47] <triveni> jim are we going to do dbquiesce
[08/12 01:48] <JimE_zOS> nope..
[08/12 01:48] <triveni> sorry 
[08/12 01:48] <triveni> it will come down on its own
[08/12 01:48] <JimE_zOS> just letting them come down naturally 
[08/12 01:48] <triveni> my bad
[08/12 01:48] <triveni> we just have to let them come up
[08/12 01:48] <JimE_zOS> and you should see some copies down 
[08/12 01:49] <triveni> 12 13 17
[08/12 01:49] <triveni> so what's the plan
[08/12 01:49] <JimE_zOS> grab the REN$SRCH member 
[08/12 01:49] <JimE_zOS> JG I 
[08/12 01:49] <triveni> should we wait for more time
[08/12 01:49] <triveni> ok
[08/12 01:50] <JimE_zOS> and then set teh copy number and type to the values 
[08/12 01:50] <JimE_zOS> you need for one of the copies that has come down. 
[08/12 01:50] <JimE_zOS> keep track of which copies you've done
[08/12 01:50] <triveni> ok i will
[08/12 01:50] <JimE_zOS> check the job output to make sure it ran correctly 
[08/12 01:51] <JimE_zOS> REN$CRE is for the CRE copies (which also need to be done one at a time)
[08/12 01:51] <06Amit_zOS> sr allocated
[08/12 01:51] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/12 01:52] <06Amit_zOS> jim.. can you check cl2 now?
[08/12 01:52] <06Amit_zOS> i see 276 now
[08/12 01:53] <JimE_zOS> I like what I see. 
[08/12 01:53] <JimE_zOS> but I think you have some bonus datasets
[08/12 01:53] <JimE_zOS> PZ00.PROD1.PROD.CP21.FG.NWRK10
[08/12 01:54] <06Amit_zOS> they are gone now
[08/12 01:54] <06Amit_zOS> deleted
[08/12 01:55] <triveni> jim m changing in ren$srch, i did jg i and wrote 12 as copy number. since its down and not in active job list.
[08/12 01:55] <triveni> m gonna submit it
[08/12 01:55] <JimE_zOS> fine, Triveni. 
[08/12 01:55] <triveni> ok
[08/12 01:55] <JimE_zOS> and, yes, Amit, I think U R fine now. 
[08/12 01:55] <JimE_zOS> so you too can start to rename things using REN$SRCH and REN$CRE 
[08/12 01:56] <JimE_zOS> or whatever JCL you want. 
[08/12 01:56] <JimE_zOS> (mine is still just an option) 
[08/12 01:57] <triveni> i can see pz00 got renamed to pl00
[08/12 01:57] <06Amit_zOS> could you remind me how you look at what copies are up?
[08/12 01:57] <triveni> m just verifying its run
[08/12 01:58] <triveni> go to iof
[08/12 01:58] <triveni> at sysk
[08/12 01:58] <triveni> if u r checking cluster 2
[08/12 01:58] <triveni> den in job name do sr*
[08/12 01:58] <triveni> u ll b able to see
[08/12 01:58] <JimE_zOS> yep, IOF, prefix SR* 
[08/12 01:59] <06Amit_zOS> 22,23,27,28 have come down i believe
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> datasets are renamed correctly for 12
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> it seems so
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> i verified it
[08/12 02:02] <JimE_zOS> done with Cluster 3 
[08/12 02:02] <JimE_zOS> moving to Cluster 4 
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> wow u r fast
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> will take baby steps
[08/12 02:02] <triveni> will reach there
[08/12 02:03] <triveni> i hv verified the new volume name and tracks
[08/12 02:05] <triveni> i did for copy 13
[08/12 02:06] <triveni> but it looks like i got pl00 with fg datasets
[08/12 02:06] <triveni> i just ran ur job
[08/12 02:07] <06Amit_zOS> 22,23,27,28 renamed
[08/12 02:07] <JimE_zOS> did you set the type, Triveni? 
[08/12 02:07] <triveni> PL00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CP13.FG.NWRK00
[08/12 02:07] <triveni> i didnt set it
[08/12 02:07] <JimE_zOS> which is WRONG 
[08/12 02:07] <JimE_zOS> that would be why 
[08/12 02:07] <triveni> yeah its a bg copy
[08/12 02:07] <JimE_zOS> I said, set teh copy number and set the type. 
[08/12 02:08] <triveni> how should i correct it
[08/12 02:08] <triveni> i can run a rename on them
[08/12 02:08] <JimE_zOS> good thing for you to figure out. 
[08/12 02:08] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:08] <triveni> should i leave this copy rename for now
[08/12 02:08] <triveni> i ll come to it later
[08/12 02:09] <triveni> and focus on the other copy renames
[08/12 02:09] <triveni> is that ok
[08/12 02:09] <JimE_zOS> no....because that means that you have killed SR013 and we can't start it. 
[08/12 02:09] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:09] <triveni> i ll fix it 
[08/12 02:09] <JimE_zOS> which, of course, leaves us vulnerable. 
[08/12 02:09] <JimE_zOS> can't just put copies on the shelf 
[08/12 02:09] <JimE_zOS> eventually you won't have anything to run. 
[08/12 02:09] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:10] <06Amit_zOS> renaming and B1,B2,B3,B6,B7,B8 since they are down
[08/12 02:12] <JimE_zOS> k...good list 
[08/12 02:12] <JimE_zOS> Cluster 4 is done. 
[08/12 02:14] <JimE_zOS> spot checking datasets. 
[08/12 02:14] <JimE_zOS> in particular, looking for PZ01 datasets (old production NWRK datasets) 
[08/12 02:15] <triveni> i have made the rename jcl for copy 13
[08/12 02:15] <JimE_zOS> and checking that the PL00.CUST datasets I find now match my copy list and that the copy type/DSNs match

[08/12 02:15] <triveni> am setting type as bg
[08/12 02:16] <JimE_zOS> k....that looks fine. 
[08/12 02:16] <triveni> removed ur if cond checks and the extra rename proc
[08/12 02:16] <06Amit_zOS> how long before these come down Jim?
[08/12 02:16] <06Amit_zOS> SR020K

[08/12 02:16] <06Amit_zOS> SR029B
[08/12 02:16] <JimE_zOS> they won't come down until the bridge window ends. 
[08/12 02:16] <JimE_zOS> ie...they are our safety net. 
[08/12 02:17] <06Amit_zOS> I see
[08/12 02:17] <06Amit_zOS> then that means i am done with renaming for now is it?
[08/12 02:18] <JimE_zOS> possibly....probably even. 
[08/12 02:18] <JimE_zOS> spot checking. 
[08/12 02:19] <triveni> problem
[08/12 02:19] <triveni> but its tracks are 5000
[08/12 02:19] <triveni> and i know why that happened
[08/12 02:19] <JimE_zOS> I like UR list of PZ01 (old prod) datasets 
[08/12 02:19] <triveni> i ll hv to fix it 
[08/12 02:20] <JimE_zOS> STOP 
[08/12 02:20] <JimE_zOS> what are you doing? 
[08/12 02:20] <triveni> i didnt do anything more
[08/12 02:20] <JimE_zOS> k....I'll rephrase. 
[08/12 02:20] <JimE_zOS> what do you want to do? 
[08/12 02:20] <triveni> it renamed the earlier fg copies to pl00
[08/12 02:21] * Disconnected

Session Start: Sat Aug 12 02:21:15 2017

[08/12 02:21] * Set by ChanServ on Fri May 12 11:17:17
[08/12 02:21] * ChanServ sets mode: +o Amit_ZOS
[08/12 02:21] <JimE_zOS> for which copy?  Is this 13 we are talking about? 
[08/12 02:21] <triveni> and i only changed the name from fg to bg.. but its tracks didnt change coz they were 5000 
[08/12 02:21] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:21] <triveni> so now wen i ran rename job
[08/12 02:21] <triveni> it looks fg but its tracks are 5000
[08/12 02:21] <JimE_zOS> oh, oh...I get it. 
[08/12 02:21] <triveni> sorry
[08/12 02:22] <triveni> it looks bg 
[08/12 02:22] <triveni> i can correct it..
[08/12 02:22] <JimE_zOS> so....the current PL00.....CP13 datasets say BG but they are allocated at the FG size. 
[08/12 02:22] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:22] <JimE_zOS> do NOT delete or reallocate
[08/12 02:22] <triveni> no no not dat
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> we already have bg datasets pz00 types
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> we have to rename them to pl00
[08/12 02:23] <JimE_zOS> you just need more renaming. 
[08/12 02:23] <JimE_zOS> so the current PL00 datasets go to PZ00 
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> and these pl00 to pz00
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> with fg name
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:23] <JimE_zOS> and the current PZ00 datasets go to PL00
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> yes
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> exactly
[08/12 02:23] <triveni> should i do it
[08/12 02:24] <06Amit_ZOS> srry, i was not on ss.. wave 1 is not yet started right?
[08/12 02:25] <JimE_zOS> nope...Wave 1 on hold 
[08/12 02:25] <JimE_zOS> yes, please, Triveni 
[08/12 02:25] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:25] <JimE_zOS> Amit, I've spot checked UR PZ01 and PL00.CUST datasets and I like the copy mix. 
[08/12 02:25] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. thank you
[08/12 02:27] <triveni> m doing one by one
[08/12 02:27] <triveni> so there will be no PL00 for few secs
[08/12 02:27] <triveni> as they will be PZ00
[08/12 02:27] <triveni> is that ok
[08/12 02:27] <JimE_zOS> that's fine. 
[08/12 02:27] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:28] <JimE_zOS> as long as you are only talking about CP13 datasets

[08/12 02:31] <triveni> yes
[08/12 02:31] <triveni> just trying to be careful
[08/12 02:31] <JimE_zOS> k...sure...please finish with that copy. 
[08/12 02:32] <triveni> perfect
[08/12 02:32] <triveni> worked
[08/12 02:32] <triveni> its fine now
[08/12 02:32] <triveni> i ll do the remaining for cluster 1
[08/12 02:34] <JimE_zOS> k...sure 
[08/12 02:35] <JimE_zOS> STOP 
[08/12 02:35] <JimE_zOS> why did you do copy 14 ? 
[08/12 02:35] <JimE_zOS> it is still up and running.

[08/12 02:35] <JimE_zOS> STOP
[08/12 02:36] <JimE_zOS> I cancelled UR TSO session to get your attention
[08/12 02:36] <06Amit_ZOS> i tried calling her
[08/12 02:37] <JimE_zOS> a cancelled TSO session should slow her down 
[08/12 02:37] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/12 02:37] <JimE_zOS> she signed right back on. 
[08/12 02:37] <JimE_zOS> so I cancelled it again. 
[08/12 02:38] <JimE_zOS> I suppose I can just revoke her account. 
[08/12 02:38] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:38] <triveni> why
[08/12 02:38] <triveni> it was down
[08/12 02:38] <triveni> that's why
[08/12 02:38] <JimE_zOS> Why oh why are you renaming datasets of that are still up? 
[08/12 02:39] <JimE_zOS> I can see the matrix 
[08/12 02:39] <JimE_zOS> I know exactly what copies are up and when they are down. 
[08/12 02:39] <JimE_zOS> I'm like the OLS Santa. 
[08/12 02:39] <JimE_zOS> so, no....they are not down. 
[08/12 02:40] <triveni> can i see the spool please
[08/12 02:40] <JimE_zOS> as long as you don't submit any more jobs, yes. 
[08/12 02:40] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:41] <06Amit_ZOS> these are still running :

[08/12 02:41] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:41] <triveni> i was focusing on the deactivated job list
[08/12 02:41] <JimE_zOS> but you have renamed datasets for 14, 15 and 16
[08/12 02:41] <triveni> yes i did
[08/12 02:42] <JimE_zOS> WHY
[08/12 02:42] <06Amit_ZOS> why?
[08/12 02:42] <JimE_zOS> we discussed this. 
[08/12 02:42] <triveni> will it crash
[08/12 02:42] <JimE_zOS> we are NOT renaming datasetes for copies which are running. 
[08/12 02:42] <triveni> the copies
[08/12 02:42] <JimE_zOS> that won't make it crash 
[08/12 02:42] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:42] <JimE_zOS> but if it does happen to crash, it won't restart 
[08/12 02:42] <triveni> ok 
[08/12 02:42] <06Amit_ZOS> it will crash if it warmstarts by the time you fix it
[08/12 02:43] <JimE_zOS> so you've exposed Cluster 1 to a potential service disruption. 
[08/12 02:43] <triveni>  i won't fix it
[08/12 02:43] <JimE_zOS> so....stop it
[08/12 02:43] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 02:43] <JimE_zOS> so let's go back to renaming datasets for the copies already down, please. 
[08/12 02:43] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:44] <triveni> 17 and 18 are down
[08/12 02:44] <triveni> m gonna rename for that
[08/12 02:44] <JimE_zOS> yes, they are....fine 
[08/12 02:46] <06Amit_ZOS> whats the longest we have held wave 1?
[08/12 02:46] <JimE_zOS> on a release night, several hours 
[08/12 02:46] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[08/12 02:47] <06Amit_ZOS> now when copies come up, do we see the nwork dsn they use in one of their startup messages?
[08/12 02:48] <JimE_zOS> not in a start-up message, no. 
[08/12 02:48] <JimE_zOS> just in the diary 
[08/12 02:48] <triveni> cluster 1 done.. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18..
[08/12 02:48] <JimE_zOS> CRE copies? 
[08/12 02:49] <triveni> only srs done
[08/12 02:49] <triveni> i ll do cre now
[08/12 02:49] <JimE_zOS> k...then Cluster 1 isn't done. 
[08/12 02:49] <JimE_zOS> just to be clear, SYSL is almost completely at risk. 
[08/12 02:49] <JimE_zOS> only SR19 is safe. 
[08/12 02:50] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:50] <triveni> sr 10 and sr 11 are also there
[08/12 02:51] <triveni> i didnt touch them
[08/12 02:51] <JimE_zOS> but they don't run on SYSL 
[08/12 02:51] <triveni> ok got it
[08/12 02:51] <JimE_zOS> they run on SYSI. 
[08/12 02:53] <triveni> 0,4,5,9 cre copies are online
[08/12 02:53] <triveni> so i won't touch them
[08/12 02:53] <JimE_zOS> perfect.
[08/12 02:56] <triveni> 1,2,3,6,7,8 done
[08/12 02:57] <triveni> so cluster 1 done i guess
[08/12 02:57] <JimE_zOS> k...spot checking. 
[08/12 02:57] <JimE_zOS> sec
[08/12 02:59] <JimE_zOS> k, I like the PZ01 datasets and the PL00.CUST datasets (and their sizes) 
[08/12 02:59] <JimE_zOS> so, I agree....we are ready for Wave 1 
[08/12 02:59] <triveni> ok
[08/12 02:59] <triveni> that means
[08/12 03:00] <triveni> we are starting cold
[08/12 03:00] <JimE_zOS> no.....
[08/12 03:00] <JimE_zOS> COLD has already run 
[08/12 03:00] <JimE_zOS> CRIT and COLD have already run, in fact. 
[08/12 03:00] <triveni> so we are starting copies
[08/12 03:00] <JimE_zOS> they have to complete cleanly or you can't start copies. 
[08/12 03:00] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:00] <JimE_zOS> we'll have OPS do it, but yeah, we are ready for Wave 1 start-up 
[08/12 03:01] <06Amit_ZOS> lcrecheck failure
[08/12 03:01] <06Amit_ZOS> is that us?
[08/12 03:01] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 03:01] <JimE_zOS> shouldn't be. 
[08/12 03:01] <JimE_zOS> looking. 
[08/12 03:03] <JimE_zOS> oh....DW LCRE 
[08/12 03:03] <JimE_zOS> SE88LCRE$CHECK 
[08/12 03:03] <JimE_zOS> SE88LCRE$CHECK 
[08/12 03:03] <triveni> is it coz of us
[08/12 03:03] <triveni> or something we can ignore
[08/12 03:03] <JimE_zOS> you tell me, Triveni. 
[08/12 03:03] <JimE_zOS> if you were oncall, you'd have to figure that out. 
[08/12 03:04] <triveni> i ll look at the job E1DCxxxK
[08/12 03:04] <JimE_zOS> so this is good practice. 
[08/12 03:05] <06Amit_ZOS> i checked in se00* error list and it was not there.. so i was comforted a bit
[08/12 03:05] <triveni> wher can i find this job
[08/12 03:05] <triveni> i checked in tsoc spool
[08/12 03:05] <triveni> i mean savrs too
[08/12 03:06] <triveni> and also in tsow savrs
[08/12 03:08] <triveni> got the job 
[08/12 03:08] <triveni> in savrs
[08/12 03:09] <triveni> E1DC897K UNVCMDER - STEP WAS NOT RUN
[08/12 03:10] <triveni> E1DC897K RUN$CHK  UNVCMD      16
[08/12 03:10] <triveni> this step failed with rc 16
[08/12 03:11] <JimE_zOS> ok....so in your oncall capacity, what does that mean and what are you going to do about it? 
[08/12 03:12] <triveni> the host could be down
[08/12 03:12] <triveni> that's why this step failed
[08/12 03:13] <triveni> sometimes the servers go down
[08/12 03:13] <JimE_zOS> k....so show me the uptime data that proves that is the problem, please. 
[08/12 03:14] <JimE_zOS> I'm going to let the bridge window end 
[08/12 03:14] <JimE_zOS> but I'm holding Wave 2 
[08/12 03:15] <JimE_zOS> so we can work on the remaining copies shortly 
[08/12 03:17] <triveni> Process 23468 started at remote time 03:00:06 08/12/17.
[08/12 03:17] <triveni> ended with exit code 16 at remote time 03:00:06 08/12/17.
[08/12 03:17] <triveni> dis is what i could find
[08/12 03:17] <06Amit_ZOS> the application had no external dependencies, and no successors, it runs on top of every hour from what i see and if the 4 am runs fine, i would just complete it and look at it in the morning when i can get some help
[08/12 03:18] <triveni> yeah to wait..
[08/12 03:18] <triveni> will be my call as well..
[08/12 03:18] <JimE_zOS> ok, Triveni, but how does that show a server bounce? 
[08/12 03:19] <JimE_zOS> my point here is that guesses are fine while you are building theory.  
[08/12 03:19] <JimE_zOS> we all do that. 
[08/12 03:19] <JimE_zOS> but then you have to find data that supports your guess. 
[08/12 03:19] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:20] <JimE_zOS> if you can't, it might be time to rethink and build new theory. 
[08/12 03:20] <JimE_zOS> so the initial guess of "servers go down" has no supporting data.....cause that isn't what happened. 
[08/12 03:21] <triveni> server started
[08/12 03:21] <JimE_zOS> and, for the record, guessing a zLinux image crashed wouldn't be anywhere in my top 25 guesses. 
[08/12 03:21] <triveni> that i can see
[08/12 03:21] <06Amit_ZOS> :-)
[08/12 03:21] <triveni> some process is not working
[08/12 03:21] <JimE_zOS> a process might have started, but the server itself did not. 
[08/12 03:21] <JimE_zOS> ok, something is working. 
[08/12 03:21] <JimE_zOS> but as an oncaller, that still isn't actionable. 
[08/12 03:21] <06Amit_ZOS> 21,24,25,26 are down.. going to rename them
[08/12 03:22] <JimE_zOS> you have to turn that into a specific box, copy, process, etc. 
[08/12 03:22] <06Amit_ZOS> shall i go ahead jim?
[08/12 03:22] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:22] <JimE_zOS> so you have something to examine and fix. 
[08/12 03:22] <JimE_zOS> why don't you wait for all of the bridge copies to come down, Amit. 
[08/12 03:22] <triveni> i can check webi and see if some box is not working
[08/12 03:22] <JimE_zOS> then we can just finish the clusters. 
[08/12 03:22] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/12 03:23] <JimE_zOS> but the job tells you which box it doesn't like 
[08/12 03:23] <JimE_zOS> so you don't have to hunt for something. 
[08/12 03:23] <JimE_zOS> just look where teh job ran 
[08/12 03:23] <06Amit_ZOS> i dont have the config char at home(i really should have) so don't remember which of those were bridge
[08/12 03:23] <triveni> psc1897 is the box
[08/12 03:24] <JimE_zOS> k....so you don't need webI to look for a mystery box. 
[08/12 03:24] <JimE_zOS> you know the "where" already 
[08/12 03:25] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:25] <triveni> i can log into the box
[08/12 03:25] <06Amit_ZOS> now i think all of them are down
[08/12 03:25] <triveni> and check for log files
[08/12 03:25] <triveni> will that work
[08/12 03:25] <JimE_zOS> it is a good place to start. 
[08/12 03:25] <JimE_zOS> but you still haven't told me what is wrong. 
[08/12 03:26] <JimE_zOS> remember...we are "those" people. 
[08/12 03:26] <JimE_zOS> so we have to get to the bottom line. 
[08/12 03:26] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:26] <JimE_zOS> not good enough to wait
[08/12 03:26] <JimE_zOS> have to find and understand. 
[08/12 03:26] <06Amit_ZOS> all bridge copies are down...
[08/12 03:26] <JimE_zOS> k, Amit. 
[08/12 03:27] <JimE_zOS> then we can tidy up. 
[08/12 03:29] <JimE_zOS> let's finish up the NWRK stuff. 
[08/12 03:29] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/12 03:29] <JimE_zOS> we remain exposed and configuration thin
[08/12 03:29] <JimE_zOS> we'll come back to the LCRE issue 
[08/12 03:29] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:31] <JimE_zOS> Cluster 3 is done. 
[08/12 03:31] <06Amit_ZOS> 20,21,24,25,26,29 done
[08/12 03:32] <triveni> in cluster 1, 14 and 16 are now down
[08/12 03:34] <JimE_zOS> Cluster 4 is done. 
[08/12 03:35] <06Amit_ZOS> moving to B4-BG,B5-FG,B9-BG right jim?
[08/12 03:37] <JimE_zOS> yes, true 
[08/12 03:38] <JimE_zOS> spot checks in clusters 3 and 4 look right to me. 
[08/12 03:38] <triveni> copy 10 and 11 are now down
[08/12 03:38] <triveni> i ll rename that
[08/12 03:38] <triveni> 12,13,17,18 are in active list
[08/12 03:39] <06Amit_ZOS> you can check cl02 jim
[08/12 03:39] <JimE_zOS> those were done before, Triveni, right? 
[08/12 03:39] <JimE_zOS> k, Amit. 
[08/12 03:40] <triveni> not 10 and 11
[08/12 03:40] <JimE_zOS> Amit, how about copy B0 ? 
[08/12 03:40] <JimE_zOS> no, 10 and 11 are bridge copies. 
[08/12 03:40] <06Amit_ZOS> oh yeah..
[08/12 03:40] <06Amit_ZOS> sec
[08/12 03:41] <JimE_zOS> so they were up and running as our safety net. 
[08/12 03:41] <JimE_zOS> but down now. 
[08/12 03:41] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[08/12 03:41] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 03:41] <triveni> so should i rename them
[08/12 03:42] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[08/12 03:43] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:43] <JimE_zOS> cluster 2 looks good, Amit. 
[08/12 03:43] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/12 03:43] <JimE_zOS> we should be free to finish everything in the cluster now, Triveni. 
[08/12 03:44] <06Amit_ZOS> triveni would have to do 10,11,14,15,16 and 19 right?
[08/12 03:45] <JimE_zOS> 15 and 16 were already done. 
[08/12 03:45] <JimE_zOS> so here list of copies isn't going to match your list, Amit. 
[08/12 03:45] <triveni> i have renamed from 10 to 18 
[08/12 03:45] <JimE_zOS> but as this point, we are free to finsih. 
[08/12 03:46] <triveni> 19 is down
[08/12 03:46] <triveni> i ll rename that too 
[08/12 03:46] <06Amit_ZOS> but ideally it would have had to match my list if everything went smoothly right? just pondering on the predictability 
[08/12 03:46] <06Amit_ZOS> clusterwise
[08/12 03:46] <JimE_zOS> yes...matchd
[08/12 03:46] <JimE_zOS> match, even 
[08/12 03:47] <06Amit_ZOS> k
[08/12 03:48] <06Amit_ZOS> once all clusters are clear to go, we will have wave 2 and then we check diaries>
[08/12 03:48] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[08/12 03:48] <triveni> so copies 10 to 19 i have renamed
[08/12 03:49] <JimE_zOS> yes, Amit, true. 
[08/12 03:50] <JimE_zOS> good, Triveni.  I think we are just missing some CRE copies 
[08/12 03:50] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 03:57] <triveni> so we are waiting for all the copies to come down?
[08/12 03:58] <JimE_zOS> I'll say it again the hopes that it registers this time. 
[08/12 03:58] <JimE_zOS> we are FREE TO FINISH all copies
[08/12 03:58] <triveni> does that mean
[08/12 03:58] <triveni> we can rename all
[08/12 03:58] <triveni> even though they are up
[08/12 03:59] <JimE_zOS> it means stop looking at what is up.  The time to do that was before the bridge window ended. 
[08/12 03:59] <triveni> ok
[08/12 03:59] <triveni> got it
[08/12 03:59] <JimE_zOS> now we do ALL copies. 
[08/12 03:59] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:00] <triveni> check cluster 1 in that case please
[08/12 04:00] <triveni> i think its all good
[08/12 04:00] <JimE_zOS> sure....looking 
[08/12 04:00] <JimE_zOS> it isn't all there, yet. 
[08/12 04:00] <triveni> its there..
[08/12 04:00] <JimE_zOS> sec...and I'll tell you which copy
[08/12 04:00] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 04:01] <JimE_zOS> looks like A9 is missing. 
[08/12 04:01] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:03] <06Amit_ZOS> nothing left to 'do' on cl2 right? just monitoring is left?
[08/12 04:03] <triveni> ok same here
[08/12 04:04] <JimE_zOS> right....monitoring and diary check
[08/12 04:04] <JimE_zOS> I like Cluster 1 now. 
[08/12 04:04] <JimE_zOS> so I'll allow Wave 2 to run. 
[08/12 04:04] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:05] <triveni> that will start the copies
[08/12 04:05] <JimE_zOS> it will, yes. 
[08/12 04:05] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:05] <triveni> fingers crossed..
[08/12 04:06] <JimE_zOS> should be starting now. 
[08/12 04:06] <triveni> yeah
[08/12 04:06] <triveni> will i be able to see the nwork dataset name there
[08/12 04:06] <triveni> the new ones
[08/12 04:06] <triveni> in copy start up
[08/12 04:07] <JimE_zOS> nope
[08/12 04:07] <06Amit_ZOS>  in diary
[08/12 04:08] <JimE_zOS> sorry....not in the started task log
[08/12 04:08] <JimE_zOS> just the diary
[08/12 04:08] <triveni> is there anyway of knowing that nwork datasets are picked up the new ones..
[08/12 04:08] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:08] <JimE_zOS> you'll see the dataset names in the diary 
[08/12 04:08] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:08] <JimE_zOS> and those are new and unique 
[08/12 04:09] <JimE_zOS> I do think, if we botched a dataset, the SR might through that out to the STC log. 
[08/12 04:09] <JimE_zOS> as a missing system dataset message. 
[08/12 04:09] <triveni> L00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CPA0.FG.NWRK00
[08/12 04:09] <triveni> L00.CUST.COMN.PROD.CPA0.FG.NWRK01
[08/12 04:09] <triveni> i can see it in diaries
[08/12 04:09] <triveni> sorry P got omitted
[08/12 04:10] <triveni> its the fcards its showing 
[08/12 04:10] <JimE_zOS> and since those names are much different from the prior dataset names, easy to see that we have picked up the new stuff. 
[08/12 04:10] <triveni> yes
[08/12 04:13] <06Amit_ZOS> dont see 29 in the current set of diaries..
[08/12 04:13] <06Amit_ZOS> maybe it just came up
[08/12 04:16] <JimE_zOS> wave 2 app is now complete. 
[08/12 04:16] <JimE_zOS> so the current diary should have all expected copies. 
[08/12 04:16] <JimE_zOS> and we've caught up to webI 
[08/12 04:16] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:19] <06Amit_ZOS> do you do mj.srdiary today or inuse Jim?
[08/12 04:19] <triveni> now m getting empty diaries
[08/12 04:20] <triveni> sorry..it takes time to fill
[08/12 04:20] <triveni> got the content
[08/12 04:21] <06Amit_ZOS> yup i can see all copies using the new ones
[08/12 04:21] <JimE_zOS> sec....I have a wrapper that I use and I don't remember what it does. 
[08/12 04:21] <JimE_zOS> sec
[08/12 04:22] <06Amit_ZOS> Triveni, is A3 up?
[08/12 04:22] <triveni> m checking
[08/12 04:23] <06Amit_ZOS> i didnt see that in the diary
[08/12 04:23] <triveni> notin jobs
[08/12 04:23] <JimE_zOS> I use "inuse" 
[08/12 04:23] <triveni> not in spool its not
[08/12 04:23] <JimE_zOS> keep in mind that we don't run all copies all of the time. 
[08/12 04:23] <JimE_zOS> in fact, we are only running 16 copies per cluster right now. 
[08/12 04:24] <06Amit_ZOS> oh a3 is not up all the time you mean?
[08/12 04:24] <JimE_zOS> so we know that 4 copies per cluster are down. 
[08/12 04:24] <JimE_zOS> I'm saying that the config changes 
[08/12 04:24] <06Amit_ZOS> 10 sr copies and 6 cre copies?
[08/12 04:24] <06Amit_ZOS> per cluster
[08/12 04:24] <JimE_zOS> webI is a good place to look because I change that configuration dynamically throughtout the day 
[08/12 04:25] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:25] <JimE_zOS> and, yes, 10 search/6 browse
[08/12 04:26] <06Amit_ZOS> i have webi issues as usual
[08/12 04:27] <JimE_zOS> we should get that fixed. 
[08/12 04:27] <JimE_zOS> webI isn't perfect, but it does help cut the world in half when something is goofed. 
[08/12 04:30] <triveni> cluster 1 diary looks so far good
[08/12 04:33] <JimE_zOS> to me too. 
[08/12 04:33] <JimE_zOS> in fact, all four clusters look fine. 
[08/12 04:33] <JimE_zOS> no missing system file messages 
[08/12 04:33] <JimE_zOS> no trace of prod1.prod.cp datasets 
[08/12 04:33] <JimE_zOS> and the pl00.cust datasets are well represented 
[08/12 04:35] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:35] <triveni> wat's the plan
[08/12 04:35] <triveni> should we wait for our pager to beep 
[08/12 04:35] <JimE_zOS> yeah....I think we are done. 
[08/12 04:36] <JimE_zOS> I'll close the change request. 
[08/12 04:36] <triveni> ok
[08/12 04:36] <JimE_zOS> and we'll hope that the fab people don't make a big deal about DW not being up.  
[08/12 04:36] <JimE_zOS> cause that was our fault. 
[08/12 04:36] <06Amit_ZOS> was it?
[08/12 04:36] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah. 
[08/12 04:37] <triveni> how
[08/12 04:37] <triveni> explain
[08/12 04:37] <JimE_zOS> not the LCRE issue....but DW not being up at all, yeah....our fault. 
[08/12 04:37] <JimE_zOS> on Monday
[08/12 04:37] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/12 04:37] <06Amit_ZOS> if thats all, Goodnight Jim!
[08/12 04:37] <JimE_zOS> and Triveni will share her findings on the LCRE check failure on Monday too. 
[08/12 04:38] <JimE_zOS> G & Q night/weekend, all 
[08/12 04:38] <triveni> yeah was about to say that
[08/12 04:38] <triveni> Thanks Jim!!
[08/12 04:38] <triveni> I will be more careful and excercise caution in next run
[08/12 04:39] <triveni> Goodnight everyone!!

[08/14 08:49] <02charlie> btw, [08/12 03:05] <Amit_ZOS> i checked in se00* error list and it was not there.. so i was comforted a bit
[08/14 08:50] <02charlie> the application in error was SE88LCRE$CHECK
[08/14 08:50] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. i got to know later that that was for DW
[08/14 08:50] <02charlie> so a mask of se00* wouldnt have found it
[08/14 08:50] <02charlie> SE88* is always dw

[08/14 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> woah! would you folks be talking in today RAP meeting!??????
[08/14 09:51] <dsk_hbe> would we be?  I have no plans.  Why do you ask?
[08/14 09:51] <dsk_hbe> oh the config item.  Wayne will likely speak to thar
[08/14 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> awesome!
[08/14 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> and who'd be talking about SR Gateway to Eric and Scott?
[08/14 09:54] <dsk_hbe> unclear.  I know very little about it's config at the level that they need to know it.  Jim may know more, not sure.  If not, it might have to be a dev like Anita
[08/14 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> cool, if allowed, i might just sit in for that session!
[08/14 09:55] <dsk_hbe> I could probably figure out what they needed but it'd take me some looking around to do that.  Oh and it may actually be Cassidy as well.
[08/14 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah.. i see
[08/14 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> although i only see our MVS team in the mail
[08/14 09:57] <dsk_hbe> Scott woudl likely think we'd know.  I think Rebecca Haberlandt, who left us years ago, was the one that set that all up long ago.  It is likely something we shoudl know more about, but not something I have ever needed to learn... set up and done... know what I mean?
[08/14 09:58] <dsk_hbe> anyway, we'll see what Jim says and if he doesn't know enough to help Scott, we'll go from there
[08/14 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS>   Gotcha
[08/14 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. getting coffee and then the meeting
[08/14 09:58] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/14 10:02] <dsk_hbe> fyi, put myself in daytime and took Charlie out, but fyi2, I'm out Tuesday and Wednesday so I can't stay there for tomorrow.  I will be drugged for my MRI... no help to anyone ;-)
[08/14 10:02] <02charlie> then why take me out just for today? :)
[08/14 10:03] <dsk_hbe> because it's a day of work that I plan to work.  You can have it back when I leave
[08/14 10:03] <02charlie> lol, okie dokie :)
[08/14 10:03] <02charlie> you can throw me back in when you go
[08/14 10:03] <dsk_hbe> k
[08/14 10:03] <02charlie> good luck with the mri (routine, i hope?)
[08/14 10:04] <dsk_hbe> yeah, though I dread it every year... will be glad ot have it over and have the doctor follow-up over.
[08/14 10:04] <02charlie> i'll bet
[08/14 10:06] <02charlie> sorry if im a bit distracted, im trying to figure out why they were trying to divide 0 by 0, the machine doesnt like that

[08/14 10:25] <JimE_zOS> while Santa is never banned, it seems that he does get sick from time to time. 
[08/14 10:25] <JimE_zOS> fighting a sore throat and the start of a cold 
[08/14 10:25] <JimE_zOS> I didn't sleep much as a result. 
[08/14 10:26] <JimE_zOS> so if nobody objects, I'll just rest and check my lists :-)
[08/14 10:26] <dsk_hbe> sounds like a good idea!
[08/14 10:26] <JimE_zOS> oh, I see you are on the good list :-)
[08/14 10:26] <dsk_hbe> ;-)

[08/14 10:30] <02charlie> torment
[08/14 10:31] <02charlie> these are all hs classmates who also are horribly punny :)
[08/14 10:31] <02charlie> i try to beat them to the pun-ch :D
[08/14 10:31] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/14 10:31] <02charlie> it's my only defense :D
[08/14 10:58] <Amit_away> Morning Jim!
[08/14 10:59] <Amit_away> Get well soon!
[08/14 10:59] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/14 11:02] <06Amit_zOS> Good news! Im gonna be an uncle!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-) :-) :-)
[08/14 11:02] <02charlie> no, you are an uncle, the baby just hasnt made its appearance yet. :) congratulations!
[08/14 11:03] <06Amit_zOS> I won 2 games of tennis and lost 4 kgs!
[08/14 11:03] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you !  that's why i said i'm gonna be!
[08/14 11:03] <02charlie> 8-)
[08/14 11:03] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[08/14 11:04] <06Amit_zOS> i went to columbus with a huuuuge collection of fruits!
[08/14 11:05] <06Amit_zOS> never have I gone to wholefoods and never have i ever brought organic fruits.. but yesterday i brought  whoole bunch of them!
[08/14 11:06] <06Amit_zOS> although I had to bring the papaya back, apparently they are not great for carrying woman!
[08/14 11:06] <dsk_hbe> really?  I never knew that, but also may never have eaten a papaya in my life ;-)
[08/14 11:07] <dsk_hbe> congrats on the uncle status!!
[08/14 11:07] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you! :-)
[08/14 11:07] <02charlie> hmm, never heard that before, and that would be very surprising that it would be bad for them
[08/14 11:09] <06Amit_zOS> yeah, but then again, i had no clue whatsoever what fruits to take.. i just asked the lady at wholefoods to select stuff for me after I let her know the purpose of it]
[08/14 11:11] <06Amit_zOS> So, my sister has gained a kind of a queen status... if she says the sky is brown, it is brown, if she asks for an icecream in the peak of the winter, she gets the icecream in the peak of winter
[08/14 11:12] <02charlie> oh, yeah
[08/14 11:12] <06Amit_zOS> Really fun to see how my brother manages this!
[08/14 11:12] <dsk_hbe> as it shoudl be ;-)
[08/14 11:12] <02charlie> Rule 1 :D
[08/14 11:20] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Debbie, once the switch hitters are effective on september 1st, wouldn't you need to make some changes in your nightly jobs to get the right data?
[08/14 11:25] <dsk_hbe> yep, when the time comes... there are other jobs we need to consider as well.  So we likely shoudl start a list.  
[08/14 11:25] <06Amit_zOS> awesome!
[08/14 11:25] <dsk_hbe> the one that the devs rely on is erjcsor.  It needs the BG list modified... really simple.  Just gotta remember to do it.
[08/14 11:25] <06Amit_zOS> let us know what we could help you with!
[08/14 11:26] <dsk_hbe> you are welcome to be the starter of the list!
[08/14 11:26] <06Amit_zOS> Sure
[08/14 11:26] <dsk_hbe> thing is most of them will need changed next day.... if you know what I mean
[08/14 11:27] <06Amit_zOS> when should we start?
[08/14 11:27] <dsk_hbe> when shodul we start the changes?  the day after the personalities of the copies change.  So if that happens on a Saturday night/Sunday morning, the changes need done for the Monday run of most of the jobs on your list since Sunday will be teh first day we actually run with that config
[08/14 11:28] <dsk_hbe> as far as my jobs they are low priority really.  I can always rerun most of them, though it's easier not to have to
[08/14 11:29] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[08/14 11:40] <06Amit_zOS> il be back after i fix me some lunch
[08/14 11:40] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/14 12:09] <02charlie> i dont know what jack's issue is with just paging somebody
[08/14 12:09] <02charlie> sheesh, just read his email
[08/14 12:09] <dsk_hbe> I'm peeking so you don't need to Charlie and then will let AMit as well when he's back
[08/14 12:09] <02charlie> k
[08/14 12:10] <02charlie> i finally finished up my analysis of the CREXPG abend yesterday and sent out a ticket on it
[08/14 12:10] <02charlie> i need to f/u with an email to prakash
[08/14 12:11] <02charlie> because i suspect their stylesheet could use some bullet-proofing, but I think it's a data issue
[08/14 12:14] <dsk_hbe> any chance you are saying this due to L0 and L1 both bouncing this morning?
[08/14 12:15] <02charlie> no
[08/14 12:15] <02charlie> hmm
[08/14 12:15] <dsk_hbe> ok, wasn't sure why you were sharing... almost never know ;-)
[08/14 12:15] <02charlie> now that you mention, maybe
[08/14 12:15] <dsk_hbe> no names ont he IDs so wasn't clear to me who was using them at the time... I hate IDs like that
[08/14 12:15] <02charlie> well, i mentioned i was preoccupied earlier
[08/14 12:16] <dsk_hbe> sane IDs abending in FABC LSR diaries... W9DC5H, at least
[08/14 12:16] <dsk_hbe> starting to look familiar to what we saw last month... see if you agree.
[08/14 12:19] <dsk_hbe> looking back it might have been Jun'es release, not July's
[08/14 12:21] <02charlie> this was me: 4 114552 L106 AB- XRVZ3Z,0000,02,XXXXXXXX,F587,0014,00,....,CREXPG+0189CT02
[08/14 12:22] <02charlie> these are xml parse errors: 1 100350 L006 AB- W9DC5H,0000,D2,XXXXXXXX,K087,4877,00,....,CRECMP+0001ET02
[08/14 12:22] <dsk_hbe> the ones that caused the copy failures though, I think were not that got... and look at my LSR diaries, i.e. STAGED.UKAMBDS.CL01.DIARIES... those same sctdct ablines like fromt eh June major release time
[08/14 12:22] <dsk_hbe> got=guy
[08/14 12:23] <02charlie> and these are invalid compression codes: 4 120723 L006 AB- W9DC5H,0000,C8,XXXXXXXX,F059,4635,00,....,CRECMP+018A4
[08/14 12:23] <02charlie> and yes, i think youre right, even aside fro rule 1 :D
[08/14 12:23] <02charlie> from
[08/14 12:23] <02charlie> and i looked at the LSR diaries first
[08/14 12:24] <dsk_hbe> ok, so that was somethign you worked in June, so I'll let you say if the same issue here.
[08/14 12:25] <dsk_hbe> can't recall what they had to do then... remove somethign from teh fabc specific stylesheet?
[08/14 12:25] <dsk_hbe> (570)
[08/14 12:26] <02charlie> im trying to figure out what they had to do
[08/14 12:26] <dsk_hbe> yeah, struggling to find the right email chain here
[08/14 12:27] <02charlie> i think S.ALTVIEW="TOC3"
[08/14 12:27] <02charlie> was the issue
[08/14 12:27] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... found an emailf rom Jim for July with teh same sctdct concerns for that month
[08/14 12:28] <dsk_hbe> but don't see any follow-up email fro the testers
[08/14 12:29] <02charlie> i'm going to go look at l0 & l1
[08/14 12:29] <dsk_hbe> I didn't see ablines on those copies, fwiw.
[08/14 12:29] <dsk_hbe> finally found the email chain I think from June... want me to forward?
[08/14 12:30] <02charlie> is it the RE: PRG testing for 6/15 diary validation  chain?
[08/14 12:30] <dsk_hbe> yep
[08/14 12:30] <02charlie> i found it
[08/14 12:30] <dsk_hbe> cool
[08/14 12:30] <02charlie> that chain fragmented pretty badly :)
[08/14 12:31] <dsk_hbe> sure did
[08/14 12:31] <02charlie> these are the ablines i see:

[08/14 12:31] <dsk_hbe> and same w9d guy on MVS
[08/14 12:31] <02charlie> im betting all the same s.altview settings
[08/14 12:31] <02charlie> yeah, he's the only one causing problems :)
[08/14 12:32] <dsk_hbe> well, fwiw, I see this guy on MVS too, but not LCRE - ZKDND0
[08/14 12:32] <dsk_hbe> but 12:04... not sure if I trust theyw ere done testing at noon ;-)
[08/14 12:33] <dsk_hbe> and he was only in cl3
[08/14 12:33] <02charlie> yeah, and he's an internal diligence user
[08/14 12:33] <dsk_hbe> let's hope everyone on fabc is internal... though at one time some wsk people used us... not a fan
[08/14 12:34] <dsk_hbe> oh I see him in cl1 too
[08/14 12:36] <02charlie> hmm, all the crecmp abends dont have a stylesheet identified yet, and they're all have s.altview=cite
[08/14 12:38] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, that's all I see to worry about in all of fabc mvs, lcre, and zlfd.  We'll let Amit double-check when he's back... while you enjoy the lcre crap ;-)
[08/14 12:38] <02charlie> LOL. enjoy. noot quite the word i would have used :D
[08/14 12:40] <dsk_hbe> don't lie... you LOVE it ;-)

[08/14 12:52] <dsk_hbe> the emial from Jim to RD in July mostly had ID - G07G1J, but the two I listed above are in the mix as well

[08/14 12:56] <dsk_hbe> just curious.  Is this move day for her?  maybe that is why she isn't on
[08/14 13:01] <06Amit_zOS> no.. she has already moved.. I will call her.. And i dont recall them getting back anything from july release
[08/14 13:03] <06Amit_zOS> she is on her way.. and i believe she is coming in late because we were up untill 5 am on saturday morning

[08/14 13:20] <charlie_away> what file are you looking at?
[08/14 13:20] <dsk_hbe> an ok?
[08/14 13:21] <dsk_hbe> Hi Triveni!
[08/14 13:21] <charlie_away> afternoon triveni :)
[08/14 13:21] <triveni> I started a late monday! 
[08/14 13:21] <charlie_away> and that offset is close enough to the one you're seeing today, i'll have to pull alisting to see if it's the same
[08/14 13:21] <06Amit_zOS> i dont see them in the abend report summary charlie
[08/14 13:22] <charlie_away> what "them"?
[08/14 13:22] <06Amit_zOS> anyway, i will take your word for it
[08/14 13:22] <06Amit_zOS> them--SCTDCT+015F6 
[08/14 13:23] <charlie_away> it occurred once this year...i'd have to do more diging to determine when
[08/14 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> oh like that
[08/14 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> not since june i meant
[08/14 13:23] <dsk_hbe> code 25?  those can happen anywhere within the code loop that is processing
[08/14 13:23] <dsk_hbe> just depends on when timemg decides to punch his lights out
[08/14 13:25] <dsk_hbe> just to clear things up... the 15F6 happened in March and was a code 25... not sure if it's the same issue just different offset if you are looking at a code 02 today
[08/14 13:26] <dsk_hbe> mj.abstats doesn't require much digging ;-)
[08/14 13:27] <06Amit_zOS>  btw, debbie, Anita, much like yourself is a full on roscoe person and making inroads in getting us to do the same............
[08/14 13:28] <06Amit_zOS> she says, she hardly uses tso!
[08/14 13:29] <dsk_hbe> LOL, good for her!  Actually I used TSO exclusively for the first 10 years of my carerr but when I got ehre everything was done via Roscoe so I got re-programmed... it's not so much that I prefer it as much as all my tools are there and I am too lazy to move it all to TSO ;-)
[08/14 13:30] <dsk_hbe> I just pulled a Charlie... started more water for tea and forgot... sigh ;-)
[08/14 13:30] <06Amit_zOS> Yeah.. i remember you telling us
[08/14 13:30] <charlie_away> lol
[08/14 13:31] <charlie_away> ive flipped back and forth, but prefer tso (that's where i have all my macros that make life easier)
[08/14 13:31] <charlie_away> especially in the days before cut and paste
[08/14 13:31] <dsk_hbe> all my life easier tools are roscoe ;-)
[08/14 13:32] <06Amit_zOS> which means it is the easieast for us, wherever we go, we have all the inventory, thanks to you all!
[08/14 13:33] <charlie_away> i dont like any of the abends i see in the fabc lsrs, nor do i like the CRECMP abends in the LCRE
[08/14 13:34] <charlie_away> the CREXPG abend is me testing a doc (and yes, it was bad, bad! :D
[08/14 13:37] <06Amit_zOS> XRVZ3Z is you then?
[08/14 13:44] <charlie_away> [08/14 12:21] <charlie> this was me: 4 114552 L106 AB- XRVZ3Z,0000,02,XXXXXXXX,F587,0014,00,....,CREXPG+0189CT02
[08/14 13:45] <charlie_away> its not always me, but it was today
[08/14 14:05] <charlie_away> so is some going to reply to jack? or did domeone aleady do that?
[08/14 14:07] <dsk_hbe> I was leaving that to you (or Amit) after you completed your investigation
[08/14 14:08] <charlie_away> well, i can do that
[08/14 14:09] <06Amit_zOS> Sure Charlie!
[08/14 14:09] <dsk_hbe> well, I certa8nly don't know what your conclusions are so likely best ;-)
[08/14 14:09] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... need to trim my nails ;-)
[08/14 14:09] <charlie_away> lol
[08/14 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie, Gordon was here looking for you..
[08/14 14:37] <06Amit_zOS> Did you get him?
[08/14 14:37] <charlie_away> no
[08/14 14:37] <dsk_hbe> he emailed just a bit ago so maybe he went with that
[08/14 14:38] <charlie_away> he did indeed
[08/14 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> He had asked me where you sit..
[08/14 14:38] <dsk_hbe> did you tell him Kentucky?
[08/14 14:38] <charlie_away> lol
[08/14 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> i told him 'at home'
[08/14 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> i gave him the info, about the speciality of Thursdays in LN
[08/14 14:40] <charlie_away> and a week from thursday, i think i will stay home and go to lunch with some of my hs classmates. they're going to be eating lunch just down the hill from me
[08/14 14:40] <06Amit_zOS> nice
[08/14 14:53] <dsk_hbe> Charles :-)
[08/14 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> yeah
[08/14 14:54] <dsk_hbe> do you like that as much as I like being called Debra?
[08/14 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> Charles Xavier
[08/14 14:54] <dsk_hbe> ;-) He's a very important man ;-(
[08/14 14:54] <dsk_hbe> er, ;-)
[08/14 14:55] <dsk_hbe> darn fingernail ;-)
[08/14 14:55] <06Amit_zOS> or prince Charles.. you sound like a royalty!
[08/14 14:56] <06Amit_zOS> But Debbie, why didn't they name you 'Debbie'?
[08/14 14:56] <dsk_hbe> Prof X is way more important... however, I guess he's dead, huh?
[08/14 14:56] <dsk_hbe> I guess it's not the thing to not have a formal name... I don't know any Debbie who isn't mor formally named Debra or Deborah, sadly...
[08/14 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> but, the formal name exist only papers right?
[08/14 14:58] <dsk_hbe> unfortunately I have carried it forward far too much.  I shodul have told these people I was Debbie before they created the Debra email ID ;-)
[08/14 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/14 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> your last name is also pretty cool.. i was a fan of Cadbury's Diarymilk chocolates---To die for1
[08/14 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[08/14 15:01] <dsk_hbe> :-) Kambury, on the other hand, is an Albanian name.  My husband's father's parents were from Albania
[08/14 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> Ah!
[08/14 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> nice
[08/14 15:02] <dsk_hbe> my maiden name, Bowshier, has a much less scary background... a long line of farmers.... salt of the earth ;-)
[08/14 15:02] <06Amit_zOS> Ah!
[08/14 15:03] <06Amit_zOS> what does R stand for in JRE!???
[08/14 15:03] <dsk_hbe> I knew thsi once... hmmm
[08/14 15:03] <06Amit_zOS> 8-D
[08/14 15:05] <dsk_hbe> Robb according to a Google search which we all know is completely trustworthy ;-)
[08/14 15:05] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/14 15:14] <dsk_hbe> I think I buy Joe's reply but for a different reason I think than what he is going after.  I'm thinking baout it, but so far all the DBs I've checked were definitely at a later gen in prod
[08/14 15:19] <charlie_away> still concerned aboout the CRECMP abends
[08/14 15:19] <charlie_away> i'd be happy with the LSR abend explanations
[08/14 15:19] <dsk_hbe> ok, I getit I think... double-checking... yeah, I'll let you decide on those
[08/14 15:27] <dsk_hbe> sigh... I'm workign on a reply... thanks for stepping on that Charles! ;-)
[08/14 15:27] <dsk_hbe> see I got called Debra when I was in trouble, so I'm carrying that forward to you ;-)
[08/14 15:28] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/14 15:35] <dsk_hbe> thre!
[08/14 15:36] <dsk_hbe> if they do end up being related, Charlie, it coudl be that some of the bases are still available in FABC, but when the aset was created it was under prod... so perhaps is causing confusion to a FABC rendering???
[08/14 15:37] <charlie_away> ooww, good thought!
[08/14 15:38] <dsk_hbe> lemme check one of yur tuids
[08/14 15:39] <dsk_hbe> good grief... even older - This Answer Set entry was CREATED on:               07/27/17 (Thu) at 11:11:39
[08/14 15:39] <charlie_away> and if you look at the attachment from Jeff, that's exactly what they're doing
[08/14 15:39] <dsk_hbe> that's for your last tuid in your email - a6a77d60-810a-11e7-bd04-c06a-e6c0b900
[08/14 15:39] <charlie_away> sheesh
[08/14 15:39] <dsk_hbe> these people are slightly clueless ;-)
[08/14 15:40] <dsk_hbe> but at least now we aren't l;;-)
[08/14 15:40] <dsk_hbe> ahem ;-)
[08/14 15:40] <charlie_away> lol
[08/14 15:44] <dsk_hbe> Jeff is a good egg
[08/14 15:45] <charlie_away> yeah, he's another person i trust around here :)
[08/14 15:45] <dsk_hbe> definitely... I'm glad someone grabbed him when he was let go from dev... he's too good not to have a round... too in depth background to lose!
[08/14 15:48] <charlie_away> yep

[08/15 10:55] <06Amit_ZOS> why are we changing chasm variables for pfd then?
[08/15 10:55] <06Amit_ZOS> its not ours right?
[08/15 10:55] <02charlie> i think we actually own pfd, TP we dont own
[08/15 10:55] <02charlie> two different applictions
[08/15 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> pfd anmd tp are different!?
[08/15 10:56] <02charlie> yes
[08/15 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. i don't quite remember that very well
[08/15 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> although now that you said it, Gail might have had mentioned something casually like that
[08/15 10:56] <02charlie> its complicated :)
[08/15 10:57] <06Amit_ZOS> no doubt
[08/15 10:57] <triveni> I remember getting to know about PFT threads and all.. we monitor PFD hung threads..
[08/15 10:58] <02charlie> yep
[08/15 10:58] <triveni> i can forward u that mail Amit

[08/15 11:03] <triveni> sure
[08/15 11:42] <triveni> brb
[08/15 11:49] <JimE_zOS> stepping away for some lunch 
[08/15 11:49] <JimE_zOS> and maybe smoke a pack or two. 
[08/15 11:49] <06Amit_ZOS> Had no idea Jim was here!
[08/15 11:49] <06Amit_ZOS> did not see the howdy!
[08/15 11:50] <JimE_zOS> not "here", exactly. 
[08/15 11:50] <JimE_zOS> At home. 
[08/15 11:50] <06Amit_ZOS> you HBE then!
[08/15 11:50] <JimE_zOS> so I can keep my germs to myself. 
[08/15 11:50] <06Amit_ZOS> hope you are doing better!
[08/15 11:50] <JimE_zOS> I guess I feel better.  Still sound terrible, tho. 
[08/15 11:50] <02charlie> lol @ the smoking
[08/15 11:55] <06Amit_ZOS> That's quite okay Jim.. as long as you don't have a second career as a mail vocalist in a band or any such roles
[08/15 11:56] <02charlie> hey, that smoking voice can be quite popular :)
[08/15 11:57] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, this young generation could develop such tastes too.. quite possible
[08/15 12:02] <06Amit_ZOS> 030320 A106 AB-I7ZQG8F,0001,25,IJNOPKNL,0BWZ,0510,01,    ,SFDCMP+0012AZ##

[08/15 12:03] <06Amit_ZOS> SFDCMP? seen that before?
[08/15 12:03] <02charlie> 25 is a time punch i think
[08/15 12:08] <02charlie> and no, we havent seen SFDCMP abends, but the fact that it's a time punch just means that transaction was tossed because it had exceeded the allotted time
[08/15 12:08] <02charlie> im guessing we might see 7ZQG8F in out piggy list
[08/15 12:08] <02charlie> our
[08/15 12:10] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[08/15 12:10] <06Amit_ZOS> man, i think i need to print out the abend code listing..
[08/15 12:10] <06Amit_ZOS> i don't want to be going and checking all the time
[08/15 12:11] <02charlie> it's in the messages manual under message 06

[08/16 13:29] <06Amit_ZOS> it was a time punch

[08/17 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey what was yesterdays page about? INC01615597 whats HFS?
[08/17 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> i was driving so couldn't come online at the time
[08/17 09:36] <dsk_hbe> I was still on PTO yesterday and haven't caught up in email yet.  If I get to it before someone else answers you I'll make up something ;-)
[08/17 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Sure..

[08/17 09:50] <dsk_hbe> I think that request ticket was off drifting in limbo, Amit
[08/17 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah.. that was my guess.. lol.. suddenly when wayne asked about it, it got dropped in our queue!
[08/17 09:51] <dsk_hbe> Charlie moved it there I think... I haven't read that email yet
[08/17 09:52] <dsk_hbe> yeah, he did this morning... did you not get that email from Charlie?
[08/17 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> just saw
[08/17 09:53] <dsk_hbe> ok, good... was worry the distribution list was broken
[08/17 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> no, i think it got left off of the unread messages maybe cz i glanced over it in my phone
[08/17 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway, all is well
[08/17 09:56] <dsk_hbe> cool

[08/17 10:26] <dsk_hbe> I see teh INC01615597 now, Amit... it wasn't ours so Charlie sent it to systems programming.  A full file system is a dngerous thing as if we maxed out we could crash the system.  Looks like Herby is still investigating what caused it to max.
[08/17 10:26] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/17 10:27] <dsk_hbe> we have these traps reporting that we are approaching full so we can act quickly to avoid full
[08/17 10:27] <02charlie> good morning again to amit, and good morning to debbie, triveni and jim
[08/17 10:27] <dsk_hbe> we can certainly get these same tickets for file systems that we do control and we have to investigate quickly to find who the culprit is... often caused by large dumps
[08/17 10:28] <dsk_hbe> hi Charlie
[08/17 10:28] <triveni> good morning Charlie!!
[08/17 10:28] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/17 10:29] <triveni> what do we do if we are reaching max
[08/17 10:29] <triveni> do v remove some files
[08/17 10:29] <triveni> i mean do a cleanup
[08/17 10:29] <triveni> ?
[08/17 10:30] <02charlie> oh, btw, the uce change requires a regular change request. and i've forgotten, do we need a lead time, or a cab meeting to get that done?
[08/17 10:30] <dsk_hbe> that will require a training session to show you how to investigate I think... but yes, we will usually remove a ton of dumps.  I remember one really bad day when DW was going whacko... Gail spent the better part of her day deleting dumps as they were filling up as fast as she coudl delete them.  eventually the fabsup folks got the process stopped... we were close to shutting down their LFDs ;-)
[08/17 10:31] <02charlie> brb, i need to check something in the car
[08/17 10:31] <triveni> ok debbie.. wenever u think u have time.. 
[08/17 10:31] <dsk_hbe> One never knows, Charlie.  I'd put it in for when you want to do it and see what happens.  Sometimes they approve it without the CAB... you just never know
[08/17 10:32] <dsk_hbe> ok, I have added it to my list of things I keep promising to train with you guys
[08/17 10:32] <triveni> thanks Debbie :)
[08/17 10:33] <06Amit_zOS> :-)
[08/17 10:36] <triveni> charlie..I can do the f-card change for UCE count.
[08/17 10:46] <02charlie> lmc when we can do it
[08/17 10:46] <triveni> ok
[08/17 10:46] <02charlie> ytiveni, you can make the change to the f-cards
[08/17 10:46] <triveni> ok
[08/17 10:46] <02charlie> dont schedule the application or run the f-cards yet
[08/17 10:46] <triveni> sure
[08/17 10:50] <02charlie> sorry i was waylaid by gordon onmy way to the car
[08/17 10:50] <triveni> ok
[08/17 10:50] <02charlie> now, i'm going to make a comfort stop, get coffee, and go to my 1-on-1
[08/17 10:51] <triveni> ok charlie
[08/17 10:53] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[08/17 10:53] <triveni> morning Jim
[08/17 10:53] <JimE_zOS> and I'm trying not to be Patient Zero. 
[08/17 10:53] <dsk_hbe> hiya, Jim
[08/17 10:55] <06Amit_zOS> Hey Jim!
[08/17 10:55] <JimE_zOS> sometimes zero is great (number of payments left, taxes due, pounds left to goal weight) and other times not so great (refund expected, vacation days left, miles till empty). 
[08/17 10:55] <JimE_zOS> pretty sure Patient Zero is bad. 
[08/17 10:56] <06Amit_zOS> you sure know how to explain yourself!
[08/17 10:56] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[08/17 10:56] <triveni> wow
[08/17 10:57] <triveni> I liked the definition
[08/17 10:57] <triveni> ;)
[08/17 10:58] <JimE_zOS> we are on another countdown here.  ERE is back in Athens on Sunday. 
[08/17 10:58] <JimE_zOS> but this time, she is taking her things with her.  So her "big girl" life starts this fall. 
[08/17 10:59] <06Amit_zOS> Woah! SOunds awesome!
[08/17 11:00] <dsk_hbe> that's a HUGE thing :~-)  (<-- Mom tears)
[08/17 11:00] <JimE_zOS> she has already started with the warm ups.  Totaled our car, bought her own, totaled that, bought another one.  And now she has discovered that buying insurance isn't any fun at all. 
[08/17 11:00] <dsk_hbe> oh my
[08/17 11:00] <06Amit_zOS> Good lessons to start with
[08/17 11:00] <JimE_zOS> she might be a little aggressive behind the wheel. 
[08/17 11:00] <06Amit_zOS> it will get better
[08/17 11:01] <JimE_zOS> she called my agent to get a policy and they won't cover her. 
[08/17 11:01] <JimE_zOS> well, Nationwide won't. 
[08/17 11:01] <JimE_zOS> the agent brokered another policy for her. 
[08/17 11:01] <JimE_zOS> but all of the sudden dad complaining about the insurance bill rings a little less hollow for her. 
[08/17 11:01] <dsk_hbe> hey, so you use an independent insurance agent?  How do you like that?
[08/17 11:02] <JimE_zOS> Still Nationwide agent, but they represent different companies, I guess. 
[08/17 11:02] <JimE_zOS> never had it come up before to be honest. 
[08/17 11:02] <dsk_hbe> interesting
[08/17 11:02] <JimE_zOS> Martha and I have Nationwide (house, cars, ATV and William's new motorcycle) 
[08/17 11:03] <dsk_hbe> I know nothing about the independent thing but have been recommended to switch by some smart people so we're investigating
[08/17 11:03] <JimE_zOS> ERE went to the same agency but she has Progressive. 
[08/17 11:04] <dsk_hbe> thanks fro teh info... our investigation continues
[08/17 11:05] <JimE_zOS> I know that ERE is using one of the plug in car data capture devices. 
[08/17 11:05] <JimE_zOS> she gets reports of every drive
[08/17 11:05] <dsk_hbe> I've seen Progressive commercials advertising htose
[08/17 11:05] <JimE_zOS> I'm hoping that thing will help modify her driving habits. 
[08/17 11:06] <JimE_zOS> I've heard that those backfire on some people. 
[08/17 11:06] <JimE_zOS> think U R a good driver and the device disagrees so your rates go up. 
[08/17 11:06] <dsk_hbe> freaky
[08/17 11:07] <JimE_zOS> I live in fear of what the device would think of a certainly other driver in this house. 
[08/17 11:07] <JimE_zOS> certain, that is. 
[08/17 11:07] <JimE_zOS> ie, I won't be using one unless forced. 
[08/17 11:08] <dsk_hbe> are you an aggressive driver, Jim? ;-)
[08/17 11:08] <JimE_zOS> :-)  No, I'm not. 
[08/17 11:09] <JimE_zOS> Martha, on the other hand accelerates to stop signs, starts to turn the corner before stopping, etc. 
[08/17 11:09] <dsk_hbe> yikes
[08/17 11:09] <JimE_zOS> I really hate they way she goes down ONeall Road hill 
[08/17 11:10] <JimE_zOS> blind corner so I hug the right side of the road. 
[08/17 11:10] <JimE_zOS> Martha, not so much 
[08/17 11:10] <dsk_hbe> :-(
[08/17 11:12] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, page me next time evans family is on the road! lol
[08/17 11:12] <JimE_zOS> so you can be in a different zip code?  Good idea. 
[08/17 11:16] <06Amit_zOS> Im sure they will be fine Jim.. I had a few friends who were pretty aggressive..(back in India, not quite in touch, that's why the 'had') but they had some sort of a blessing in that they never got into trouble.
[08/17 11:20] <06Amit_zOS> speaking of blessed, so am i.. i once had a head on collision while i was on a bike with another bike.. (i was not riding though)
[08/17 11:20] <06Amit_zOS> all involved got away without any serious injuries.. the bikes looked terrible though..
[08/17 11:21] <dsk_hbe> what in the world was the othr person doing to have hit you while you were not moving?
[08/17 11:23] <triveni> am waiting for charlie..

[08/17 11:23] <triveni> and simillary for background
[08/17 11:24] <06Amit_zOS> oh,  both of us were moving allright, you see there were no 'lanes' in that particular road and we couldn't see this guy coming towards us because this aggressive rider that i was talking about was right in front of us blocking our view and he then made a sudden turn towards the left and out off nowhere a bike from the oncoming traffic hit us head on. 
[08/17 11:24] <dsk_hbe> oic, yikes
[08/17 11:25] <06Amit_zOS> naive days..
[08/17 11:25] <dsk_hbe> we all have had those I am sure

[08/17 12:36] <JimE_zOS> I have a security meeting at 1pm and afterwards, I think I'm going to a utility project for someone.  And by "someone", I mean the kids. 
[08/17 12:39] <06Amit_zOS> kids? originals or duplicates?
[08/17 12:40] <JimE_zOS> I was thinking "team effort" 
[08/17 12:40] <JimE_zOS> it will require a couple of parts
[08/17 12:46] * JRE_zOS has joined #theRock
[08/17 12:46] * JRE_zOS was kicked by ChanServ (You are not permitted to be on this channel.)
[08/17 12:46] * ChanServ sets mode: +b *!*@610C2D4A.55E49B4C.BC41EC25.IP
[08/17 12:46] * JimE_zOS has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[08/17 12:47] * ChanServ sets mode: -b *!*@610C2D4A.55E49B4C.BC41EC25.IP
[08/17 12:47] <dsk_hbe> poor Jim
[08/17 12:47] * JimE_zOS has joined #theRock
[08/17 12:47] * ChanServ sets mode: +qo JimE_zOS JimE_zOS
[08/17 12:49] <JimE_zOS> stupid network
[08/17 13:05] <triveni_away> back
[08/17 13:05] * triveni_away is now known as triveni
[08/17 13:06] <triveni> charlie
[08/17 13:06] <triveni> should i submit it
[08/17 13:06] <triveni> or should i run the job tomorrow
[08/17 13:21] <02charlie> tomorrow
[08/17 13:21] <triveni> well i have tested it 
[08/17 13:21] <triveni> i ran it
[08/17 13:22] <triveni> but i ll schedule tomorrow
[08/17 13:36] <JimE_zOS> just a little safety tip here....
[08/17 13:37] <JimE_zOS> it doesn't matter for production because production renames HAVE TO BE MANUALLY SCHEDULED 
[08/17 13:37] <JimE_zOS> but FABC, C1 and DW will auto-rename F-Cards. 
[08/17 13:38] <triveni> ohh
[08/17 13:38] <triveni> thanks for the tip Jim.. I ll remember..
[08/17 13:38] <JimE_zOS> ie, if a set of prep F-Card datasets is found for any of those environments, the rename will happen automatically during the very next start of day cycle. 
[08/17 13:38] <triveni> got it
[08/17 13:38] <JimE_zOS> prod requires action, DW/FABC/C1 require awareness. 
[08/17 13:38] <triveni> ok
[08/17 13:39] <02charlie> so i think you should re-run the last good fcard set
[08/17 13:40] <02charlie> oh, but c1 has its own set of f-cards, as do all the other environments
[08/17 13:40] <02charlie> so please ignore me
[08/17 13:40] <02charlie> i think i need more rocket fuel :)
[08/17 13:41] <triveni> ok
[08/17 13:43] <06Amit_zOS> lunch
[08/17 13:43] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/17 14:01] <02charlie> triveni, i would like you to rename P$170818 to P$170819, and change the history information to reflect the new name and that the effective date is 8/19
[08/17 14:05] <triveni> ok
[08/17 14:05] <triveni> charlie
[08/17 14:05] <02charlie> yes
[08/17 14:05] <02charlie> COMMAND YES NOT FOUND
[08/17 14:05] <triveni> hahha
[08/17 14:06] <02charlie> typed it in the wrong window
[08/17 14:06] <triveni> done!
[08/17 14:07] <02charlie> thx
[08/17 14:07] <triveni> wc!
[08/17 14:15] <02charlie> changes look good, thx!
[08/17 14:16] <triveni> sure :)
[08/17 14:16] <02charlie> rocket fuel time
[08/17 14:36] <Amit_away> back
[08/17 14:36] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/17 14:39] <triveni> its raining here

[08/17 14:42] <dsk_hbe> I hope it stays with you and away from us... our pool has come close to overflow level a couple times in the last week... unfortunately the overflow drain goes into the neighbors' yard because our pool builders weren't thinking... ongoing battle to get them to extend it out to the curb... duh
[08/17 14:43] <02charlie> *sigh*
[08/17 14:43] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. problems problems problems...
[08/17 14:43] <06Amit_zOS> if its not one thing its 11 others
[08/17 14:43] <dsk_hbe> 1st world problems ;-)
[08/17 14:44] <dsk_hbe> deja vu... guy just called and said it will be another week to get that done... we shall see ;-)
[08/17 14:45] <06Amit_zOS> A guy once said you are either in a problem, just got out of one or heading towards one!
[08/17 14:45] <dsk_hbe> don't ever build a house... you spend a lot of time in that cycle ;-)
[08/17 14:46] <JimE_zOS> rain brewing here
[08/17 14:46] <JimE_zOS> starting to hear rumbles of thunder. 
[08/17 14:47] <02charlie> i think i see cats and dogs :)
[08/17 14:47] <JimE_zOS> a freak lightening strike of my truck would be OK. 
[08/17 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/17 14:48] <JimE_zOS> I just need a piece big enough to see the VIN. :-)
[08/17 14:48] <dsk_hbe> you want to replace conference room F105?
[08/17 14:48] <triveni> I think problms keeps life interesting ;)
[08/17 14:48] <JimE_zOS> I do, yes. 
[08/17 14:48] <triveni> or else it will be boring :D
[08/17 14:49] <dsk_hbe> I wish you luck! :-)
[08/17 14:49] <02charlie> lol
[08/17 14:49] <dsk_hbe> I agree, Triveni... kinda why I like the work we do here ;-)
[08/17 14:49] <triveni> hahha yeah ;)
[08/17 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> So Triveni, Build a house
[08/17 14:49] <triveni> so embrace it..and live it.. and we will make it alive ;) heeheh
[08/17 14:49] <triveni> Dats the dream
[08/17 14:50] <triveni> I will one day
[08/17 14:50] <triveni> for sure :D
[08/17 14:50] <dsk_hbe> Pythagorean triple day - such a geek ;-)
[08/17 14:50] <triveni> hahaha
[08/17 14:50] <JimE_zOS> k....as promised, I have a building assignment for the kids.  Debbie and Charlie are welcome to follow along, but I want to see what Amit and Triveni can build w/out help.  
[08/17 14:51] <02charlie> k
[08/17 14:51] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/17 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> k.. lets see how this one keeps life interesting
[08/17 14:51] <JimE_zOS> I need an actively maintained list of OLS IDs used on the classic system. 
[08/17 14:51] <02charlie> and i'll probably leave here in a bit to pick up a relative and her daughter from childrens in cincinnati and take then to my niece's for dinner
[08/17 14:52] <JimE_zOS> if you want to beat the storm, Charlie, feel free to run. 
[08/17 14:52] <02charlie> i'm hoping that the storm dies down, it's too late to beat it :)
[08/17 14:52] <JimE_zOS> so here is what I want: 
[08/17 14:52] <JimE_zOS> k....sorry 
[08/17 14:53] <triveni> ok
[08/17 14:53] <JimE_zOS> 1) a daily extract of all of the IDs used on the classic SA.  I don't care about IDs used in the LFD or SR space
[08/17 14:53] <triveni> ok
[08/17 14:53] <JimE_zOS> I'll suggest that you use the MONITOR.DAILY as a source of this data. 
[08/17 14:54] <triveni> even daily diaries will give us info
[08/17 14:54] <triveni> ?
[08/17 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> offcourse
[08/17 14:54] <JimE_zOS> the daily extract should have all IDs listed once along with the LEXIS date (which is also in the MONITOR.DAILY
[08/17 14:54] <JimE_zOS> there are probably several places to get the data. 
[08/17 14:55] <JimE_zOS> but before you try and find an alternative, you might want to look at the MONITOR.DAILY 
[08/17 14:55] <triveni> PE00.LPAED.MONITOR.DAILY
[08/17 14:55] <triveni> it has goop
[08/17 14:55] <JimE_zOS> actually, nevermind....just use teh MONTIOR.DAILY because I have a need to gather retro data and that will be way easier with MONITOR.DAILY
[08/17 14:56] <JimE_zOS> you aren't in the habit of gathering requirements before you start designing things, are you? 
[08/17 14:56] <JimE_zOS> in the IT world, that's bad. 
[08/17 14:57] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/17 14:57] <JimE_zOS> k...daily extract.  Each ID, listed only once, with the LEXIS date
[08/17 14:57] <triveni> ok
[08/17 14:58] <JimE_zOS> oh, and the IDs should be in alpha order. 
[08/17 14:58] <triveni> sure
[08/17 14:58] <JimE_zOS> I'll suggest that you do this extraction using SYNCSORT 
[08/17 14:58] <JimE_zOS> (we don't have DFSORT, BTW) 
[08/17 14:58] <triveni> ok
[08/17 14:59] <JimE_zOS> and we'll need JCL to build this extract file.  The JCL doesn't have to be OPC ready, of course. 
[08/17 14:59] <JimE_zOS> once that is in place, then you'll need to build a tool to be a summary file of classic usage 
[08/17 15:00] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:00] <JimE_zOS> in this dataset, I'll want to see the OLS ID (still in sorted order), the first date teh ID was found, the last usage date 
[08/17 15:00] <JimE_zOS> all dates should be in yymmdd format 
[08/17 15:01] <JimE_zOS> I'll also be clear that I don't care about the time of usage. 
[08/17 15:01] <JimE_zOS> ie, the ID could be used after midnight
[08/17 15:01] <JimE_zOS> I just want the initial LEXIS date.  The before/after midnight stuff doesn't matter for this 
[08/17 15:02] <triveni> and Jim u r suggesting us to read monitor.daily
[08/17 15:02] <JimE_zOS> when you add an ID to teh summary dataset, I'll also want you to add three...
[08/17 15:02] <JimE_zOS> no....just print it out and hold the printout up to your forehead. 
[08/17 15:02] <triveni> but it has goop
[08/17 15:03] <JimE_zOS> yeah...so 
[08/17 15:03] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:03] <JimE_zOS> if you were listening to the requirements, you wouldn't know the dataset had goop 
[08/17 15:04] <triveni> i understood what u r expecting in output 
[08/17 15:04] <02charlie> rain has died down, i'm going to bolt
[08/17 15:04] <JimE_zOS> bye, Charlie. 
[08/17 15:04] <JimE_zOS> be safe 
[08/17 15:04] <triveni> bye charlie
[08/17 15:04] <06Amit_zOS> bye charlie..
[08/17 15:04] <02charlie> thanks bye all
[08/17 15:04] <JimE_zOS> k...back to the three.... 
[08/17 15:04] <dsk_hbe> bye Charlie
[08/17 15:05] <JimE_zOS> after teh ID, date of first use, date of last use....I want three one byte fields. 
[08/17 15:05] <JimE_zOS> for the initial add of an ID, make the three fields each have a value of "X" 
[08/17 15:06] <JimE_zOS> through some RACF processing, I'll change those values to either a 1 or 0 
[08/17 15:06] <JimE_zOS> but that is my problem.....you just need to put the X's in newly added records. 
[08/17 15:06] <JimE_zOS> for records already in the summary dataset, leave the values alone 
[08/17 15:08] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:08] <JimE_zOS> we'll start this as a prospective process, but I'll eventually run retro data (back to Jan 2017) through the process
[08/17 15:08] <JimE_zOS> so the data will not be added in order of occurence. 
[08/17 15:09] <JimE_zOS> so, you'll need to make sure your first date, last date logic handles that situation. 
[08/17 15:09] <JimE_zOS> JCL will be needed for teh summary file maintenace process too. 
[08/17 15:10] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:10] <JimE_zOS> it would be nice if the summary file logic could get teh OLS date from the input data so I don't have to set a parm to supply that data. 
[08/17 15:10] * charlie has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 361 seconds)
[08/17 15:10] <dsk_hbe> I need to head ot an appointment.  I'm still in daytime with Triveni and fine to stay there but if she leaves before 5, someone may want to take it.
[08/17 15:10] * dsk_hbe is now known as dsk_away
[08/17 15:10] <triveni> bye debbie
[08/17 15:10] <dsk_away> bye!!
[08/17 15:11] <triveni> i ll b online
[08/17 15:11] <JimE_zOS> bye, Debbie. 
[08/17 15:12] <JimE_zOS> G & Q night. 
[08/17 15:12] <JimE_zOS> now, for the details on the MONITOR.DAILY, 
[08/17 15:12] <JimE_zOS> that dataset is produced by a process we call "create daily". 
[08/17 15:12] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:13] <triveni> it's a job, the "create daily" process
[08/17 15:13] <triveni> ?
[08/17 15:14] <JimE_zOS> that is just our name for it.....every online system has to have a "create daily" process. 
[08/17 15:14] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:14] <JimE_zOS> so the name is a general OLS concept. 
[08/17 15:14] <JimE_zOS> not a job name. 
[08/17 15:14] <JimE_zOS> in the case of production, the job name is E30LDLYB
[08/17 15:14] <triveni> yeah.. i mean.. we must be having set of jobs for the process
[08/17 15:14] <triveni> yeah rite as u gave.
[08/17 15:15] <JimE_zOS> in that job, you'll find the program name of the routine that builds the MONITOR.DAILY 
[08/17 15:15] <JimE_zOS> I suggest you check that routine for information on the format of the MONTIOR.DAILY dataset. 
[08/17 15:17] <JimE_zOS> k....what questions do you have? 
[08/17 15:17] <triveni> i can see PGM=LXPP00
[08/17 15:17] <JimE_zOS> and if that is the problem which creates the DAILY datasets, U R there. 
[08/17 15:18] <JimE_zOS> many of our jobs have more than one step. 
[08/17 15:18] <JimE_zOS> and more than one program invocation
[08/17 15:19] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:20] <JimE_zOS> lots of rain here, BTW 
[08/17 15:20] <JimE_zOS> other questions? 
[08/17 15:20] <06Amit_zOS> just a drizzle here
[08/17 15:20] <06Amit_zOS> i don't have any yet.. need to read this multiple times..
[08/17 15:20] <06Amit_zOS> i will reach out if i have some
[08/17 15:21] <JimE_zOS> k...sure 
[08/17 15:24] <JimE_zOS> I think I'm going to add something since we are still early in the process. 
[08/17 15:24] <JimE_zOS> I think I'd like to keep track of FABC and production both. 
[08/17 15:24] <triveni> as per me.. creating a sort card.. will be a technical thing.. which we will be able to anyhow come up with.. and preparing the ouput as u want..
[08/17 15:24] <triveni> m just tryint to make sure.. m able to get the input dataset i.e. monitor daily file columns correctly.. 
[08/17 15:25] <JimE_zOS> you are still in the weeds, Triveni. 
[08/17 15:25] <JimE_zOS> this starts as a higher level thought. 
[08/17 15:26] <JimE_zOS> the dataset has a format, certainly, but you don't need to know what it is right now. 
[08/17 15:26] <triveni> but i understood ur higher level thought.. 
[08/17 15:26] <JimE_zOS> and building the sort card isn't the first thing to do. 
[08/17 15:26] <triveni> I ll try to work on ur thought then
[08/17 15:26] <JimE_zOS> so....with the FABC thing...
[08/17 15:26] <triveni> sorry.. i start thinking into implementation.. yeah i ll let u continue..
[08/17 15:27] <JimE_zOS> that means that each daily extract dataset should contain information on the OLS date and OLS name. 
[08/17 15:27] <JimE_zOS> and the summary routine should allow multiple files to be concatenated to speed processing. 
[08/17 15:27] <JimE_zOS> so we might concatenate, for a single day, the prod and FABC files. 
[08/17 15:28] <JimE_zOS> or we might take a months worth of retro prod data and process that. 
[08/17 15:28] <triveni> ok..the bigger picture..got it..
[08/17 15:30] <triveni> so first we have to make daily extract file.. and then we will maintain a summary dataset..
[08/17 15:30] <JimE_zOS> so I suppose we should have a set of production dates and FABC dates 
[08/17 15:31] <JimE_zOS> we won't need to duplicate the 3 one byte fields.  One set of those is enough. 
[08/17 15:34] <JimE_zOS> BTW, I joined daytime XM and removed Debbie. 
[08/17 15:35] <triveni> thnks Jim
[08/17 15:35] <JimE_zOS> k...so I think that covers it. 
[08/17 15:35] <triveni> m trying to understand the last line
[08/17 15:35] <JimE_zOS> I'll let you two think and discuss. 
[08/17 15:36] <JimE_zOS> since we are duplicating the date data (one set of dates for prod, one set for FABC), 
[08/17 15:36] <triveni> yeah
[08/17 15:36] <JimE_zOS> I'm pointing out that we don't need to create two sets of one byte fields at teh end of each record. 
[08/17 15:38] <triveni> yup
[08/17 15:38] <JimE_zOS> if it helps, I see the summary data record looking something like this: 
[08/17 15:38] <triveni> so only one column in smmary report
[08/17 15:39] <triveni> for three byte fields
[08/17 15:39] <triveni> lexis id, first date, last date, 3 byte fields
[08/17 15:39] <JimE_zOS> classic ID - prod first found date - prod last used date - FABC first found date - FABC last used date - X X X 
[08/17 15:39] <triveni> ohh
[08/17 15:39] <triveni> ok got it
[08/17 15:40] <JimE_zOS> each field being blank delimited. 
[08/17 15:40] <triveni> ok
[08/17 15:40] <JimE_zOS> (the - was just my way of showing different fields) 
[08/17 15:40] <triveni> yeah it can be done
[08/17 15:40] <JimE_zOS> I'll recommend coding the thing in REXX, but I guess you can code in anything that will run on the mainframe. 
[08/17 15:41] <triveni> sort inrec or outrec, we will already have our daily extract datasets.
[08/17 15:41] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I think the extract can be done via SORT. 
[08/17 15:42] <JimE_zOS> the merge logic is probably too much for SORT. 
[08/17 15:42] <triveni> for creating summary datasets, I ll have to check, I think it might work.. 
[08/17 15:43] <triveni> clubbing two file columns and creating a new dataset file.. that can be done by sort
[08/17 15:43] <triveni> but i ll check
[08/17 15:43] <JimE_zOS> SORT is capable of many things. 
[08/17 15:43] <triveni> yeah
[08/17 15:43] <triveni> I haven't tried REXX that often..but if needed i ll try it..
[08/17 15:43] <JimE_zOS> I use SORT for some more complex things, but I don't think I could pull of the merge in SOT 
[08/17 15:43] <JimE_zOS> SORT, even 
[08/17 15:44] <JimE_zOS> perhaps you have more experience with SORT than I do. 
[08/17 15:44] <triveni> I have memories of using it.. but lets see.
[08/17 15:44] <JimE_zOS> SORT/REXX whatever. 
[08/17 15:44] <JimE_zOS> I rather the routine not be in COBOL but I've certainly left that as a possibility
[08/17 15:45] <triveni> wow
[08/17 15:45] <triveni> really
[08/17 15:45] <triveni> ehheeh
[08/17 15:45] <triveni> COBOL will make our life easy
[08/17 15:45] <triveni> but m sure SORT will help out too
[08/17 15:46] <JimE_zOS> if we don't do REXX, I'd favor PLI over COBOL but I can code/understand all of the above. 
[08/17 15:49] <JimE_zOS> k....happy to answer questions but I think I'm done with the requirements. 
[08/17 15:53] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/17 15:53] <triveni> I understood the summary section..
[08/17 15:54] <triveni> M just trying to understand the extract section in thorough.
[08/17 15:56] <triveni> sorry in summary file,
[08/17 15:56] <triveni> [08/17 15:10] <JimE_zOS> it would be nice if the summary file logic could get teh OLS date from the input data so I don't have to set a parm to supply that data. 
[08/17 15:56] <triveni> m trying to understand why do we need OLS date, dat will be the name of the file?
[08/17 15:56] <triveni> is it
[08/17 15:57] <triveni> I mean the OlS date will be used for naming the file.. 
[08/17 15:57] <JimE_zOS> for naming which file? 
[08/17 15:57] <triveni> sorry just ignore  what i typed..
[08/17 15:57] <triveni> explain why we need ols date
[08/17 15:58] <triveni> please can you explain that part.. why do we need ols date..
[08/17 15:58] <JimE_zOS> because I need the OLS date downstream 
[08/17 15:58] <JimE_zOS> and if we don't capture it here, I won't have the needed data for my process. 
[08/17 15:59] <triveni> ok 
[08/17 15:59] <triveni> so we will store the OlS date in the summary file
[08/17 15:59] <JimE_zOS> furthermore, putting the OLS date only in a dataset name forces the summary routine to know each and every dataset name it is processing, parse the name to get the date.
[08/17 15:59] <JimE_zOS> you will store 4 dates in the summary file 
[08/17 16:00] <triveni> ok
[08/17 16:00] <JimE_zOS> classic ID - prod first found date - prod last used date - FABC first found date - FABC last used date - X X X 
[08/17 16:00] <JimE_zOS> four dates 
[08/17 16:01] <06Amit_zOS> So here is my understanding, The Goal as i understand it, is to build a summary file for the classic usage for PROD and FABC. In order to do this,
[08/17 16:01] <06Amit_zOS> We need to extract the classic ID's using the SA from the MONITOR.DAILY. Offcourse, I also acknowledge the requirements like you need the ID's be in
[08/17 16:01] <06Amit_zOS> alphabetical order and the format of the summary dataset that you need. And i assume, we get the first found date, the last use date and things like that 
[08/17 16:01] <06Amit_zOS> is obtained from the monitor daily? Capabilities: The summary file should be generated even if we had more than 1 extract files(with all required info).
[08/17 16:02] <JimE_zOS> generally I agree with your summary....but 
[08/17 16:03] <JimE_zOS> the first found and last used dates will come from your logic, not the MONITOR.DAILY data itself. 
[08/17 16:03] <JimE_zOS> for example, let's say that ID ABCDEF is already in the summary file 
[08/17 16:04] <JimE_zOS> and that it was placed there by processing today's data. 
[08/17 16:04] <JimE_zOS> but....in processing retro data, we find the ABCDEF ID was actually first used on March 1st of this year. 
[08/17 16:05] <JimE_zOS> so when processing older data, you might have to change your first used dates. 
[08/17 16:05] <JimE_zOS> and certainly your last used date could change every day if the ID is actively being used. 
[08/17 16:06] <triveni> ohh
[08/17 16:06] <06Amit_zOS> understood.. but when we process the retro data, we get that date(first used date) from that retro data is it?
[08/17 16:06] <JimE_zOS> so your logic will have to know what LEXIS day is being processed and decide if that is older/newer than what is already there. 
[08/17 16:06] <JimE_zOS> ish. 
[08/17 16:06] <triveni> ok
[08/17 16:07] <JimE_zOS> you'll know the OLS date from the MONITOR.DAILY password record (firsrt and last record of teh dataset) 
[08/17 16:07] <JimE_zOS> so in your extract, you'll probably want to include the OLS ID (prod or FABC) 
[08/17 16:07] <JimE_zOS> and teh OLS starting date  (first password  record) on each record in the extract file. 
[08/17 16:08] <06Amit_zOS> understood.. i feel i will be a little more comfortable once i start working it
[08/17 16:08] <triveni> yeah
[08/17 16:08] <JimE_zOS> so....when you put a bunch of extract file together, they can all be processed without thought.  No retro parm, no prespective parm, no date parm, no FABC/PROD parm. 
[08/17 16:08] <JimE_zOS> all of teh data is in the extract file 
[08/17 16:10] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/17 16:10] <06Amit_zOS> got it
[08/17 16:11] <triveni> m trying not to get confused.. but OLS starting date and prod first found date
[08/17 16:11] <triveni> are same?
[08/17 16:11] <JimE_zOS> not always, no 
[08/17 16:12] <JimE_zOS> OLS starting date is teh COLD start date of the system. 
[08/17 16:12] <triveni> how will the extract file look
[08/17 16:12] <JimE_zOS> you tell me. 
[08/17 16:12] <triveni> classic id - ols start date - prod first found date - prod last used date - 3 byte fields
[08/17 16:12] <JimE_zOS> first found date is the date your process first found the ID. 
[08/17 16:13] <triveni> yes
[08/17 16:13] <06Amit_zOS> as far as i understood, the extract file should have :
[08/17 16:13] <JimE_zOS> for the extract file?  Not exactly, no 
[08/17 16:13] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Amit...go ahead, please. 
[08/17 16:13] <06Amit_zOS> Classic ID-       OLS iD        OLS Date
[08/17 16:13] <JimE_zOS> agree. 
[08/17 16:14] <triveni> that's all
[08/17 16:14] <JimE_zOS> I can't think of anything else you'll need in that dataset. 
[08/17 16:14] <triveni> oh so the logic will be in summary file.
[08/17 16:14] <JimE_zOS> the summary file fields can all be derived from that data. 
[08/17 16:14] <06Amit_zOS> im going to have to make a decision between ezytrieve and REXX
[08/17 16:14] <triveni> yeah i m comfortable with eazytrieve
[08/17 16:15] <triveni> never used REXX in deep
[08/17 16:15] <JimE_zOS> let me help you....not easytrieve. 
[08/17 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> both will require be to do some brush up.. 
[08/17 16:15] <JimE_zOS> easytrieve isn't even y2K compliant. 
[08/17 16:15] <triveni> yes easytrive has complications i know
[08/17 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. debbie told me that you hate it
[08/17 16:15] <JimE_zOS> it could break at any time. 
[08/17 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/17 16:15] <06Amit_zOS> REXX it is then
[08/17 16:15] <triveni> yeah especially while reading file and generating output
[08/17 16:15] <triveni> some run time issues are common
[08/17 16:16] <JimE_zOS> hate is a strong word.  Let's go with "I don't trust its reliability" 
[08/17 16:16] <triveni> ok so REXX
[08/17 16:16] <06Amit_zOS> will spend some time on it.. have never used it..
[08/17 16:16] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Jim.. this will be a good experience
[08/17 16:16] <JimE_zOS> Debbie's processes can be quickjob or easytrieve.  Her stuff is grandfathered 
[08/17 16:17] <triveni> I was thinking extract file will be looking like summary file.. and we just have to club columns.. so thought of SORT
[08/17 16:17] <JimE_zOS> anything new we write should be in something other than easytrieve. 
[08/17 16:17] <triveni> now I guess I ll have to use REXX
[08/17 16:17] <JimE_zOS> at least QJ is supported. 
[08/17 16:17] <JimE_zOS> easytrieve, not so much 
[08/17 16:17] <JimE_zOS> is that a latin joke? :-)
[08/17 16:17] <06Amit_zOS> Ok Jim.. Agreed..
[08/17 16:17] <JimE_zOS> REX is Latin for "king"
[08/17 16:18] <JimE_zOS> and REXX clearly rules! 
[08/17 16:19] <triveni> Will rely on ur word!
[08/17 16:19] <triveni> :) :D
[08/17 16:19] <06Amit_zOS> Since Im in chicago and dont have the access to the material you had given me, i will rely on the internet today
[08/17 16:20] <06Amit_zOS> (for rexx)
[08/17 16:21] <06Amit_zOS> A question though.. who cares about the classic usage now?
[08/17 16:21] <triveni>  so Jim.. u ll use past data i.e. retro data
[08/17 16:21] <triveni> for running summary file
[08/17 16:22] <triveni> extract files will be created only through daily monitor..
[08/17 16:22] <triveni> i hope..i got this part right..
[08/17 16:22] <06Amit_zOS> if running = updating then yes
[08/17 16:22] <triveni> yes
[08/17 16:22] <triveni> updating
[08/17 16:23] <triveni> and morover..for extract files.. we are not providing any other input.. like past data etc..
[08/17 16:24] <triveni> Amit.. am i thinking right?
[08/17 16:26] <triveni> I think I got it..
[08/17 16:27] <06Amit_zOS> yes.. no past data to generate extract file
[08/17 16:34] <JimE_zOS> sorry....stepped away for coffee. 
[08/17 16:34] <JimE_zOS> I need the classic usage data for a security/RACF thing, Amit
[08/17 16:35] <triveni> u ll revoke the ids
[08/17 16:35] <JimE_zOS> it'll depend on what I find in the data. 
[08/17 16:35] <JimE_zOS> but possibly, yes. 
[08/17 16:36] <triveni> ok
[08/17 16:36] <JimE_zOS> k....now let's think about retro data a little bit. 
[08/17 16:37] <JimE_zOS> the way we have discussed this so far, we'll have to run a job for every day of the year back to January 1st. 
[08/17 16:37] <triveni> ok
[08/17 16:37] <JimE_zOS> then those extract files could be concatenated in a single summary run. 
[08/17 16:38] <JimE_zOS> as much fun as it would be to watch Triveni run 200 ish jobs, perhaps we need a better way to build our retro extract data 
[08/17 16:38] <triveni> my thought was in retro data 
[08/17 16:39] <triveni> how will it look
[08/17 16:39] <JimE_zOS> I think the difference is in how much time we want to spend building the extract process. 
[08/17 16:40] <JimE_zOS> all of the data, new and old, is still MONITOR.DAILY data 
[08/17 16:40] <JimE_zOS> if we want the extract to by fast to build, SORT is probably our tool of choice. 
[08/17 16:40] <triveni> ok
[08/17 16:40] <JimE_zOS> that would mean a run for each day of the year 
[08/17 16:41] <JimE_zOS> if we want to concatenate a bunch of MONTOR.DAILY datasets, we could make a very few number of runs to get our retro extract data. 
[08/17 16:41] <triveni> yeah
[08/17 16:41] <JimE_zOS> but we'll have to build program logic to accomplish that. 
[08/17 16:42] <JimE_zOS> meaning the role of SORT is reduces (or eliminated) 
[08/17 16:42] <JimE_zOS> and more time is needed to build/debug extract logic. 
[08/17 16:43] <triveni> don't we have old monitor datasets
[08/17 16:43] <triveni> like which are in cart
[08/17 16:43] <triveni> any yearly backup
[08/17 16:43] <triveni> or monthly backup
[08/17 16:43] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, i would like to see the jobs like E30LDLYB from theier datasets, not from iof.. where do i find them? 
[08/17 16:44] <JimE_zOS> almost all of our jobs go to the 2nd SAVRS DB, Amit. 
[08/17 16:44] <JimE_zOS> =A.S.S 
[08/17 16:44] <JimE_zOS> (from ISPF) 
[08/17 16:44] <06Amit_zOS> yeah. i meant not from savrs
[08/17 16:45] <JimE_zOS> oh, raw JCL. 
[08/17 16:45] <JimE_zOS> PT00.OPC.OLMR.JCLLIB 
[08/17 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> only cz i dont see them as a jcl and with all the extra stuff its hard to keep up
[08/17 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/17 16:45] <06Amit_zOS> no datasets in that name
[08/17 16:46] <triveni> change the system
[08/17 16:46] <06Amit_zOS> im on sysc
[08/17 16:46] <triveni> not sure then
[08/17 16:46] <JimE_zOS> oh, sorry...PT00.OPCA.OLMR 
[08/17 16:46] <JimE_zOS> use that as a mask. 
[08/17 16:47] <JimE_zOS> you'll find JCLLIB and SKLLIB 
[08/17 16:47] <triveni> yeah
[08/17 16:47] <06Amit_zOS> got it
[08/17 16:47] <JimE_zOS> create daily should be in JCLLIB 
[08/17 16:47] <triveni> u exlained that once
[08/17 17:00] <triveni> Goodnight Everyone!!

[08/17 17:07] * triveni_away has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 368 seconds)
[08/17 17:18] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, its easy to locate the lexis start date and time on the monitor daily, but chasing LXPP00 is like chasing a ghost
[08/17 17:18] <06Amit_zOS> i dont see any kind of clear formating
[08/17 17:19] <06Amit_zOS> and just by looking into them, columns 3-8 look like ID's but i dont know how to say if they are from SA or not
[08/17 17:21] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[08/17 17:23] <JimE_zOS> the MONITOR.DAILY comes exclusively from SA data, Amit. 
[08/17 17:24] <JimE_zOS> so you know, by definition, that those IDs are classic only IDs
[08/17 17:24] <JimE_zOS> in create daily, I'd expect to find some include-able record layout information. 
[08/17 17:34] <JimE_zOS> stepping away.  G & Q night, all 
[08/17 17:53] <06Amit_zOS> good night Jim!
[08/17 17:54] <06Amit_zOS> and thats so fortunate! Thanks

[08/18 14:04] <dsk_hbe> kthx... just wanted to make sure it wasn't just me before I report it.
[08/18 14:05] <02charlie> sure
[08/18 14:16] <dsk_hbe> fyi, Steve is aware of the CPM report problem and has the UNIX teams working on it.
[08/18 14:19] <JimE_zOS> oh, then we should do the Manila thing and report is again and again and again using as many different methods as possible.  ticket, service request, change request (?)  and email. 
[08/18 14:19] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/18 14:20] <JimE_zOS> oh, and MOC.

[08/18 14:20] <02charlie> lol
[08/18 14:20] <02charlie> its funnier listening to merlin say that
[08/18 14:21] <dsk_hbe> hey, related to nothign at all... anyone remember what email tool we used ages ago... like around when I first started here?  I was talking to Eric about such inconsequential nonsense and it bugs me I can't remember what it was.
[08/18 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PROFS
[08/18 14:22] <02charlie> oow, jim is good
[08/18 14:22] <dsk_hbe> PROFS!  thank you!!!  my goodness that was driving me crazy... and that was via TSO, right?
[08/18 14:22] <JimE_zOS> I don't think it was. 
[08/18 14:22] <JimE_zOS> PROFS is a creature of VM. 
[08/18 14:23] <dsk_hbe> sad memory... what was the delete option?  we still say it today confusing all the youngsters ;-)
[08/18 14:23] <dsk_hbe> ctrl F4?
[08/18 14:23] <JimE_zOS> I think you signed on to a VM system (I was JRE1) and used the PROFS tool which was little more than a REXX exec hiding the fact that you were using the VM capability of having a virtual card reader 
[08/18 14:24] <JimE_zOS> ie, the card reader was your "inbox" 
[08/18 14:24] <JimE_zOS> PF4 was delete, yes
[08/18 14:24] <dsk_hbe> ok, good... I just knew control was too long... PF4... whew... I can walk away from work today without THAT still bugging me ;-)
[08/18 14:24] <JimE_zOS> I'm here to help 
[08/18 14:25] <dsk_hbe> man you have a sharp memory!
[08/18 14:25] <02charlie> im beginning to think jim has an eidetic memory
[08/18 14:25] <JimE_zOS> seeing the matrix taxes me, but I can still remember some things.

[08/21 10:48] <JimE_zOS> unless you'd like to be "A"
[08/21 10:48] <triveni> hahaha

[08/21 10:49] <06Amit_zOS> Gosh.. Jim's on a roll today morning!
[08/21 10:49] <JimE_zOS> Jim is always on a roll. 
[08/21 10:49] <06Amit_zOS> already did a splash of coffee?
[08/21 10:49] <JimE_zOS> not always shared, tho. 
[08/21 10:49] <triveni> hahaha
[08/21 10:49] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, i guess you can take this: INC01619519
[08/21 10:49] <JimE_zOS> brought my splash of coffee with me from home. 
[08/21 10:49] <JimE_zOS> k...sure. 
[08/21 10:51] <JimE_zOS> ticket claimed and notes added RE: OPC calendar
[08/21 10:51] <06Amit_zOS> thanks Jim!
[08/21 10:55] <dsk_hbe> Jim, FYI because I jknow oyu track it in your Outlook calendar.  Charlie agreed to trade oncall weeks with me, 9/25 for 10/2.  I've been summoned to my sister's house to help keep her from freaking out as she preps her home for 100+ people to attend a wedding there... she is eternally grateful to Charlie ;-)
[08/21 10:55] <02charlie> lol
[08/21 10:56] <06Amit_zOS> :-D
[08/21 10:56] <06Amit_zOS> wedding with 100+ people?!!
[08/21 10:56] <dsk_hbe> her husband is NOT Happy... he's a grouch anyway... this may have sent him over the top ;-)
[08/21 10:56] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/21 11:00] <JimE_zOS> earning points with Kambury family members can't ever be a bad thing. 
[08/21 11:00] <02charlie> lol
[08/21 11:00] <02charlie> where does your sister live?
[08/21 11:01] <JimE_zOS> offering to bus tables is over the top, Charlie. 
[08/21 11:01] <dsk_hbe> they're a tough bunch... especially my side, the Bowshiers... um, don't look that up on a criminal record site... um... nevermind...
[08/21 11:01] <02charlie> lol
[08/21 11:01] <dsk_hbe> she lives in Springfield
[08/21 11:01] <02charlie> youse guys are so funny 
[08/21 11:02] <02charlie> i guess you'll be too busy for a dinner?
[08/21 11:02] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, way busy no doubt about it
[08/21 11:04] <dsk_hbe> btw, they didn't choose the date until Saturday... they will learn that freaking out Peggy with that little notice was a very bad idea ;-)
[08/21 11:05] <02charlie> well, my wife is licensed to perform marriages in ohio
[08/21 11:05] <dsk_hbe> that's cool, but I think they have that part all set.  They have lots of friends also licensed... weird that they have *lots*, but they do
[08/21 11:06] <JimE_zOS> dad did that for my brother.  Had to obtain an appointment from the Ohio Supreme Count to be a one day Probrate Judge to be legal, but that was pretty easy to work out. 
[08/21 11:07] <02charlie> nice. i thought any judge was qualified? or was he not a judge at that time?
[08/21 11:07] <dsk_hbe> oh me too
[08/21 11:08] <JimE_zOS> he was, yes, but in Ohio, at least at the time, you had to be a municiple or probate judge to officiate. 
[08/21 11:08] <02charlie> ah, interesting
[08/21 11:09] <JimE_zOS> most people who go to the "judge" to get married, find a muni judge. 
[08/21 11:10] <JimE_zOS> but there was something about being a "muni" judge that bothered dad....don't remember now what that was. 
[08/21 11:10] <JimE_zOS> so he went the probate route instead. 
[08/21 11:10] <JimE_zOS> he knew the folks in Columbus (sat for several supreme count oral arguements) 
[08/21 11:10] <JimE_zOS> so it wasn't hard to work out. 
[08/21 11:11] <JimE_zOS> the Chief Justice even drove to Lima to swear dad in for his second term. 
[08/21 11:11] <02charlie> nice
[08/21 11:12] <JimE_zOS> I met him several times.  Very nice.  All business when he wore the robe. 
[08/21 11:13] <02charlie> they usually are
[08/21 11:15] <JimE_zOS> k...turning my attention to some provisioning work. 
[08/21 11:15] <JimE_zOS> gotta do that and clean up my queue.  What a mess. 
[08/21 11:16] <dsk_hbe> Hey Charlie, your zlfd ticket was close to being another total pain... 28 of the 40 total zlfd dbutil threads took over 100 seconds to complete... you get closer to 40 and life gets ugly.  I wonder if whatever happened there will end up being related to the unifo oracle issue they had a couple times same day
[08/21 11:16] <dsk_hbe> uinfo... geez
[08/21 11:18] <02charlie> this one? INC01618662 Priority 2  multiple JMenu.JDBUTIL_ACCESS_ERROR - JMenu Server JDbutil access failure
[08/21 11:18] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[08/21 11:19] <dsk_hbe> I don't know how the hardware/dasd ties together amongst the oracle clusters but I have to wonder
[08/21 11:20] <02charlie> yeah, i think they're looking at oracle for those, especially when we got the second alpha cat
[08/21 11:20] <dsk_hbe> yes they are... though I heard Jeff say they passed it to Beula team I think... and I think she was the one that worked the last dasd related incident... I'd have to go remind myself
[08/21 11:20] <02charlie> i was very surprised they cut the ticket as a sev 2 and then didnt page it
[08/21 11:21] <dsk_hbe> yours wasn't paged?  wow... well good for them if it cleared
[08/21 11:21] <02charlie> not that i complained :D
[08/21 11:22] <dsk_hbe> I woudln't either :-)
[08/21 11:28] <dsk_hbe> an ID with teh name 'TRAINING' really makes me angry... especially when they cause issues
[08/21 11:30] <dsk_hbe> I also dislike people calling me to look at my roof
[08/21 11:31] <02charlie> methonks coffee is in order
[08/21 11:31] <JimE_zOS> well, sure....being a TX roof, it is as big as all outdoors. 
[08/21 11:31] <JimE_zOS> lots to check. 
[08/21 11:32] <dsk_hbe> these fools that think I'd hire them from a cold call are insane

[08/21 14:59] <dsk_hbe> fyi, I asked Vickie some more questions re: her C1 request.  Gonna give Joe and Wayne a chance to say if they are good with it, so I may be making the change tomorrow.
[08/21 15:00] <dsk_hbe> It's a simple change, but if the kids... er ta... want to see if they can figure out how to do it, you can find a previous run of the C1 LSRs on sysd, e, p, or h and they will start with C1*
[08/21 15:06] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/21 15:07] <charlie_away> would someone do me a favor and cancel my tso session on sysc?
[08/21 15:07] <charlie_away> thx

[08/22 10:30] <dsk_hbe> and woulda come in and listened if I wasn't so groggy that that didn't occur to me ;-(
[08/22 10:31] <02charlie> i didnt have a mtg notice for that one
[08/22 10:31] <dsk_hbe> Jim shared it with me since it's happenign my oncall weekend but I have only managed to attend one of the meetings
[08/22 10:34] <JimE_zOS> I find that it is easier to forgive me if I've shared the meeting details upfront. 
[08/22 10:34] <JimE_zOS> Amnesty rules! 
[08/22 10:35] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/22 10:35] <JimE_zOS> k....splash of coffee.....BRB 
[08/22 10:36] <02charlie> :)
[08/22 10:40] <dsk_hbe> Mike Linder's TOC tweak doesn't look to be working.  JimC added threads/more copies last night and the TOC's still look to be bouncing :-(
[08/22 10:41] <dsk_hbe> I dwell on this because it impacts users' enhanced results response time (browse)
[08/22 10:43] <02charlie> i saw that the unix release had some toc thingy in it, did this all start with the unix release?
[08/22 10:44] <02charlie> i dont recall if they said when it started in hankins meeting
[08/22 10:45] <dsk_hbe> Mike had a fix in the UNIX release that was hoped to stop the hung threads... I don't think it did that either... but hard to tell with the copies bouncing ;-)  I did see 3 threads hung on one copy yesterday for abotu an hour before it bounced so I am saying it didn't do that either.
[08/22 10:45] <JimE_zOS> back.  
[08/22 10:45] <dsk_hbe> the bouncing started with the UNIX release... hung threads have been going on forever... has taken me a whiel to convince Mike that they really were hung... he finally agreed with me.
[08/22 10:45] <02charlie> how were you able to tell toc had three hug threads
[08/22 10:46] <dsk_hbe> webi graphing.  I'll forward you the note I sent him yesterday so you can see what I graphed.
[08/22 10:46] <02charlie> ah
[08/22 10:46] <02charlie> thx
[08/22 10:46] <JimE_zOS> not to state teh obvious, but if Mike has made the copies bounce regularly (let's call is a health bounce), the threads are no longer hung. :-P
[08/22 10:47] <dsk_hbe> LOL... well he didn't respond to my note so perhaps that was his thinking too ;-)
[08/22 10:47] <02charlie> lol
[08/22 10:48] <02charlie> ah, i see what you mean in the graph, thx
[08/22 10:48] <dsk_hbe> sure!
[08/22 10:48] <dsk_hbe> when they back his changes out... which I suspect is inevitable now... you can see this happen a lot more ;-)

[08/22 11:25] <dsk_hbe> NULL?  sniff... why did that email just call me null?
[08/22 11:25] <dsk_hbe> NULL, Your Tuesday LexisNexis Employee Perks Have Arrived
[08/22 11:43] <JimE_zOS> Needed but Under appreciated LEXIS....I got nothing. 
[08/22 11:44] <JimE_zOS> need a splash of coffee and some stairs. 
[08/22 11:44] <JimE_zOS> Back shortly. 
[08/22 11:45] <JimE_zOS> maybe then I'll have an "L" word that will work in that phrase. 
[08/22 11:52] <dsk_hbe> I need a splash... of tea... brb ;-)
[08/22 11:55] <06Amit_ZOS> lol debbie!
[08/22 11:56] <dsk_hbe> back
[08/22 12:00] * triveni has joined #theRock
[08/22 12:00] * ChanServ sets mode: +o triveni
[08/22 12:00] <dsk_hbe> Jim, for when you are back... once I am sure no one has an issue with it, I will make the C1 change Vickie requested for TWF.  I assume I shoudl go ahead and make the same change in the prod clusters' dataset that we prepped back in March for teh C1 move... is that still in the plans?
[08/22 12:01] <JimE_zOS> back 
[08/22 12:01] <JimE_zOS> C1 F-Cards, sure. 
[08/22 12:02] <dsk_hbe> the TWF in the prclib
[08/22 12:02] <JimE_zOS> trying to remember what the heck I was thinking with the prod clusters dataset thingy
[08/22 12:02] <dsk_hbe> startup proc stuff
[08/22 12:02] <dsk_hbe> we created them, each of us a cluster... back in March in anticipation of the moev, I think
[08/22 12:02] <JimE_zOS> oh....start-up PROC sure. 
[08/22 12:03] <JimE_zOS> oh, but those were the SYSI, K, Q, F datasets. 
[08/22 12:03] <JimE_zOS> since C1 still doesn't run there, no need to change those. 
[08/22 12:03] <JimE_zOS> but the D/E/P/H start-up PROCs can certainly be changed. 
[08/22 12:03] <dsk_hbe> yeah, ok... I suspect we'd need to refresh just to be safe anyway, huh?
[08/22 12:04] <dsk_hbe> ok, will stick with just the C1 current datasets, thanks!
[08/22 12:04] <JimE_zOS> probably true, yes. 
[08/22 12:06] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)

[08/22 13:05] <triveni> b
[08/22 13:06] <triveni> debbie.. do u need anything for the C1 change
[08/22 13:07] <triveni> we are here.. let us know..
[08/22 13:07] <dsk_hbe> I'm making it now... but like I said yesterday a good exercise for you guys might have been to figure out what it is I am changing.
[08/22 13:07] <triveni> ok once u r done..
[08/22 13:07] <triveni> will check it
[08/22 13:08] <dsk_hbe> sounds good
[08/22 13:11] <06Amit_ZOS> lunching.. brb
[08/22 13:12] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/22 13:15] <dsk_hbe> OK, I'm done making the changes, Triveni.  See if you can figure out what needed done.  The only clue I will give you is that past runs of the C1 LSRs live on spool on SYSD, E, P, and H and are named starting with C1.
[08/22 13:15] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/22 13:26] <triveni> Jim my tso id is locked
[08/22 13:26] <triveni> for sysd and syse
[08/22 13:27] <triveni> i tried incorrect passwords
[08/22 13:27] <triveni> and it showed authorization error
[08/22 13:27] <triveni> logon rejected
[08/22 13:28] <triveni> and debbie i have a feeling.. that i understood what changes u have done..
[08/22 13:28] <triveni> lemme just confirm it once i log in..
[08/22 13:28] <dsk_hbe> pokie dokie
[08/22 13:28] <dsk_hbe> er, okie dokie
[08/22 13:33] <triveni> m trying to find and contact tso administrator as my RACF message says..but m sure he z busy.. ;)
[08/22 13:34] <dsk_hbe> always :-)
[08/22 13:34] <triveni> yeah :D ;) :)
[08/22 13:44] <JimE_zOS> SYSD and SYSE?  
[08/22 13:48] <triveni> Thanks Jim. It's working now
[08/22 13:49] <JimE_zOS> for the record, SYSD, E, P, H and Y all share a single RACF DB. 
[08/22 13:49] <triveni> ok
[08/22 13:49] <JimE_zOS> so a password reset on any ONE of those systems will impact the password on ALL of those systems. 
[08/22 13:53] <triveni> ok Jim
[08/22 13:53] <triveni> Debbie..
[08/22 13:53] <triveni> NZ00.PROD.STARTUP.PRCLIB(C1$SRCHV)
[08/22 13:53] <triveni> SET FGTWF='TWF='',TWF=08'''
[08/22 13:53] <triveni> SET BGTWF='TWF='',TWF=08'''
[08/22 13:54] <dsk_hbe> correct!  so remember what you found come time for her to request a PROD change ;-)
[08/22 13:54] <triveni> ok 
[08/22 13:54] <triveni> I want to know what is TWF
[08/22 13:55] <JimE_zOS> Transparent Work File. 
[08/22 13:55] <triveni> i understood from the mail chain it will help in negative news
[08/22 13:55] <triveni> searches
[08/22 13:55] <dsk_hbe> hey, me too... but it has been far too long since we tlked about that parm for my braint o remember
[08/22 13:55] <JimE_zOS> I think the basic idea is this....
[08/22 13:55] <dsk_hbe> oooo, Jim will edicate us!
[08/22 13:56] <dsk_hbe> did whoever is in daytime get paged for the cat call I just got an informer for?
[08/22 13:56] <JimE_zOS> in the old world, we would take one set of results and merge them with another set of results. 
[08/22 13:56] <JimE_zOS> but we had to keep doing that for every DB that had docs to contribute to the answer set. 
[08/22 13:56] <02charlie> jim is in daytime
[08/22 13:56] <triveni> and amit
[08/22 13:56] <JimE_zOS> 2-way merge. 
[08/22 13:56] <02charlie> jinx
[08/22 13:56] <JimE_zOS> TWF allows for an N-Way merge. 
[08/22 13:56] <dsk_hbe> cool, thanks, Jim!
[08/22 13:57] <JimE_zOS> at least that is my recollection. 
[08/22 13:57] <JimE_zOS> creature of Dale after he retired. 
[08/22 13:58] <triveni> so increasing the TWF count will help in merging 
[08/22 13:58] <JimE_zOS> yes, Triveni, true. 
[08/22 13:58] <JimE_zOS> on the alphaCAT call. 
[08/22 13:59] <JimE_zOS> even though webi is perfectly green. 
[08/22 13:59] <triveni> ok Thanks Jim and Debbie!!
[08/22 13:59] <dsk_hbe> it seems that it is just related to Lync per the incident... so why they sent that out I have no idea
[08/22 13:59] <triveni> and debbie, yeah for prod change.. you can tell me when to perform that
[08/22 13:59] <02charlie> my guess its the unifo again
[08/22 13:59] <dsk_hbe> webi is pretty for me too
[08/22 14:00] <02charlie> oh, i missed the lync
[08/22 14:00] <dsk_hbe> MASTER - LYNC degradation - multiple lync servers impacted
[08/22 14:00] <02charlie> i thought they were just talking about the cat
[08/22 14:00] <dsk_hbe> yeah their wording is REALLY poor
[08/22 14:00] <02charlie> ah
[08/22 14:00] <dsk_hbe> now a management alert talks about other profucts... wow... someone is doing a bad job of communicating
[08/22 14:01] <02charlie> cats and dogs here
[08/22 14:02] <02charlie> btw, no i dont get the mangler alerts
[08/22 14:02] <JimE_zOS> this sounds self inflicted. 
[08/22 14:02] <dsk_hbe> if you guys don't get management alerts (like the one I sent) I have another to share
[08/22 14:03] <02charlie> sure. how do we get on the list?
[08/22 14:03] <dsk_hbe> ok, I'll share this one too... sorry for dups (likely just to Jim)
[08/22 14:03] <dsk_hbe> I'll see if I can find a memory ont hat, Charlie
[08/22 14:03] <JimE_zOS> 4K servers impacted. 
[08/22 14:03] <02charlie> thx
[08/22 14:04] <02charlie> oh, just a few then ;)
[08/22 14:04] <dsk_hbe> oh my
[08/22 14:04] <02charlie> i think i see some larger animals now too :)
[08/22 14:04] <JimE_zOS> how on God's green earth can having 4K servers be cheaper than a single mainframe? 
[08/22 14:04] <dsk_hbe> I will never understand
[08/22 14:04] <JimE_zOS> neither will mgt, I guess. 
[08/22 14:05] <02charlie> well, the BCP logistics meeting got canceled because of the aplha cat
[08/22 14:05] <02charlie> something good there :)
[08/22 14:08] <dsk_hbe> does anyone go to those ;-)
[08/22 14:09] <02charlie> lol
[08/22 14:11] <Amit_away> back
[08/22 14:11] <Amit_away> i got the cat call
[08/22 14:12] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/22 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> all my phones went off while i was driving
[08/22 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> in the rain
[08/22 14:21] <dsk_hbe> not fun!
[08/22 14:29] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I see RETS Management in my list of subscribed items here - http://webstar.reedelsevier.com/informer/view/subscription/index.jsp   I found that entry selected under 'Other' int eh bottom lists.  I won't swear that is the choice that gets you these emails... try it and see.
[08/22 14:42] <JimE_zOS> I don't know what all of that crapCall is, but I dropped. 
[08/22 14:42] <JimE_zOS> it never had anything to do with teh mainframe 
[08/22 14:42] <JimE_zOS> so I'm out. 
[08/22 14:42] <06Amit_zOS> i never joined.. 
[08/22 14:43] <dsk_hbe> sounds like a good choice by all
[08/22 14:43] <JimE_zOS> Amit wins! 
[08/22 14:45] <dsk_hbe> who wants to do an fcard rename for me for Friday morning?
[08/22 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> friday morning i can do
[08/22 14:48] <triveni> okies
[08/22 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> whats the change?
[08/22 14:48] <dsk_hbe> ok, give me a sec and I'll tell you what to add to the change request.  Then we can talk abotu the simple change to make Thursday
[08/22 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> awesome
[08/22 14:49] <dsk_hbe> LOL... 'my computer guy' just called... he hung up when I LOL'd... I'm offended ;-)
[08/22 14:52] <06Amit_zOS> LOL
[08/22 14:53] <dsk_hbe> ok, AMit, what we are doing is reducing teh number of UCEs that we use for SDI/eclipse daily processing.  Wayne has been tuning things on the web side of eclipse processing and suggested we likely could do it here too.  It won't have much impact given the small number of searches we run, but any impact is worthwhile.  So we will be reducing the current number of UCEs we allow to run SDI searches at once from 27 to 7.
[08/22 14:53] <dsk_hbe> word that however you like int he Fcard rename... once they see classic eclipse they'll hit the who cares button quickly anyway ;-)
[08/22 14:54] <dsk_hbe> btw, I have 168 userIDs set to delete off the eclipse file tonight (via e00llsd0)... I can't figure out why this is more fun than cleaning closets ;-)
[08/22 14:55] <06Amit_zOS> hahahaha
[08/22 14:57] <06Amit_zOS> so when will i need to schedule the normal change? (I assume its not a standard change)
[08/22 14:57] <dsk_hbe> Friday morning, please
[08/22 14:58] <dsk_hbe> the only thing they may balk at is if we choose a weekend date, so I am trying to stay off that
[08/22 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> I should have worded that better... when should i create the change? is before eod today fine?
[08/22 14:58] <dsk_hbe> yep!
[08/22 14:58] <06Amit_zOS> wonderful
[08/22 14:58] <dsk_hbe> just do the change request for now and we'll talk the actual change come Thursday... it's really simple
[08/22 14:59] <06Amit_zOS> will do
[08/22 14:59] <dsk_hbe> and I so love not having to do my own change requests ;-)
[08/22 14:59] <06Amit_zOS> :) glad to be of use
[08/22 15:00] <06Amit_zOS> its a little too cold for me in office today
[08/22 15:01] <06Amit_zOS> might head home and work from there, if thats okay
[08/22 15:01] <dsk_hbe> hbe Debbie thinks that is always a good idea ;-)
[08/22 15:01] <triveni> i ll join him as well

[08/22 16:54] <triveni> bye everyone!
[08/22 16:54] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[08/22 16:54] <02charlie> bye triveni
[08/22 16:56] <JimE_zOS> I do, Charlie.  
[08/22 16:56] <JimE_zOS> What can I do 4 U? 
[08/22 16:57] <02charlie> i am wondering if you have run into this  before
[08/22 16:57] <02charlie> i have a soe extract that generates one record into a file
[08/22 16:58] <JimE_zOS> k
[08/22 16:58] <02charlie> if I extract more than one record into the file, i have no problem
[08/22 16:59] <JimE_zOS> k....sure 
[08/22 16:59] <02charlie> but with just one the Do While LINES(dataStream) loops forever 
[08/22 16:59] <02charlie> and if i put in a workaround to make sure i stop after the first one then dataRecord = LINEIN(dataStream) returns me nothing
[08/22 17:00] <JimE_zOS> is dataStream dynamically allocated? 
[08/22 17:00] <02charlie> so then when i test the result, expecting an application to show up, it tells me the application is not running, even though it is
[08/22 17:00] <02charlie> yes
[08/22 17:00] <JimE_zOS> and therein is the problme. 
[08/22 17:00] <02charlie> dataStream = openStream('&'argStem, 'READ')
[08/22 17:00] <JimE_zOS> this is a bug I found long ago and reported to IBM. 
[08/22 17:01] <02charlie> nice
[08/22 17:01] <JimE_zOS> they opted to close the issue with a documentation change rather than a code fix. 
[08/22 17:01] <JimE_zOS> so, yes, I have run into this before. :-)
[08/22 17:01] <02charlie> sheesh
[08/22 17:01] <02charlie> ok, i'll do it another way then :)
[08/22 17:01] <JimE_zOS> if you allocate the dataset yourself (ie, not using stream tools), you'll be fine. 
[08/22 17:02] <JimE_zOS> oh, wait. 
[08/22 17:02] <JimE_zOS> & means that the dataset is preallocated 
[08/22 17:02] <JimE_zOS> so stream is just opening the file for you. 
[08/22 17:02] <02charlie> yeah, the DD name is in the JCL
[08/22 17:03] <JimE_zOS> k...then not dynamically allocated. 
[08/22 17:04] <JimE_zOS> what happens in your logic if you use Do Until ?   As in Do Until ^LINES(dataStream) 
[08/22 17:04] <JimE_zOS> until being evaluated at the top of the loop, while being evaluated at teh bottom. 
[08/22 17:06] <02charlie> i havent tried that, but i have checked the value of LINES(dataStream) inside the loop, and if i have more than one record, it's 1 until the last record is read, then it's 0; if I have only one record, then it's always 1 and loops infinitely
[08/22 17:07] <JimE_zOS> yeah....pretty sure you are in my reported bug. 
[08/22 17:08] <02charlie> ok, i'll just use the execio facilities then
[08/22 17:08] <02charlie> that should solve my problem
[08/22 17:09] <JimE_zOS> ugly, but yes, doesn't have the same issue. 
[08/22 17:10] <02charlie> sheesh, what a bug! oh, right, it's not a bug, it's a feature. What a feature! :(
[08/22 17:10] <JimE_zOS> not just a feature....a DOCUMENTED feature :-)

[08/23 09:47] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I just read the change you created - CHG0164051.  Since this is an Fcard rename, don't we need it to go through OPS?  SO they'll do the close thing.  I thinkt he requirement for that means it has to say FCard on the short description
[08/23 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> oh is it? i was not sure if that rule applied only to standard changes or not
[08/23 09:49] <dsk_hbe> I'm pretty sue Jim set it up for all fcard renames... I'm trying to find his email, sec
[08/23 09:50] <dsk_hbe> yeah, he says this:
[08/23 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. letme see if i can change it
[08/23 09:50] <dsk_hbe> 5)	Note that other F-Card related changes (even those that arent standardized) will also be closed by OPS if you are careful to put F-Card in the Short Description field and ensure that Production Support L1 is the implementation group.  Us being in the Watch List is nice but not required.   
[08/23 09:50] <dsk_hbe> I'll forward this note to you
[08/23 09:51] <dsk_hbe> I guess you can leave it as is if you want but then you have to do the silly closure crud.
[08/23 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> ah, i cannot update it you mean?
[08/23 09:52] <dsk_hbe> I only meant if you didn't want to change it.  
[08/23 09:53] <dsk_hbe> but I won't be the one up at 02:15 (hopefully ;-)  knock on wood ;-) to close this out ;-)
[08/23 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> i do want to if i can
[08/23 09:53] <dsk_hbe> Lorraine Gregg is very helpful if you have trouble changing it 
[08/23 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/23 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> will reach out

[08/23 09:55] <JimE_zOS> howdy
[08/23 09:55] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[08/23 09:55] <02charlie> howdy
[08/23 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim
[08/23 09:59] <triveni> hi Jim
[08/23 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> its changed debbie..
[08/23 10:00] <06Amit_ZOS> could you see?
[08/23 10:00] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[08/23 10:00] <dsk_hbe> sec
[08/23 10:01] <dsk_hbe> great!
[08/23 10:03] <dsk_hbe> also, in case you want to figure out where in the cards we will make this change, here're some clues for you - the STRDSECT holds the layout for most (all?) of the FCard types.  It pains me to have to tell you this clue, but sometimes they represent eclipse/sdi by 'S.D.I.'  darn them... ruins your hunting to have to tell you that.
[08/23 10:06] <dsk_hbe> fyi, after last night's deletes we are down to 106 userIDs on the file and 286 searches.  Rich Petrosin came in with a late ok for his two IDs which held about 80, so yay ;-)
[08/23 10:07] <06Amit_ZOS> awesome
[08/23 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> i will check on where the change could be in sometime.. while i hop over to the cubicle

[08/23 10:38] <06Amit_ZOS> is this where we need to change?
[08/23 10:39] <dsk_hbe> yep
[08/23 10:39] <06Amit_ZOS> awesome
[08/23 10:39] <dsk_hbe> and while we are at it, I vote we change teh backup copy as well, sap1... I forget what it is set at...25?
[08/23 10:39] <dsk_hbe> or maybe it's vice versa
[08/23 10:39] <dsk_hbe> sap3 at 25 and sap1 at 27?
[08/23 10:39] <06Amit_ZOS> yes 25
[08/23 10:40] <dsk_hbe> ok, let's change both to 007
[08/23 10:40] <06Amit_ZOS> o'right
[08/23 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> ok. Jim? you have time so that i can do a demo????
[08/23 10:41] <dsk_hbe> eclipse runs on sap3, backup if needed is sap1... though don't ask me how you make it move... I've forgotten more than I remember about this stuff!
[08/23 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/23 10:48] <JimE_zOS> ditto.  Too bad too.  The SA is a nifty piece of code. 
[08/23 10:48] <dsk_hbe> it really is
[08/23 10:48] <JimE_zOS> to bad too, that is. 
[08/23 10:49] <dsk_hbe> although TPPROC gave me nightmares ;-)
[08/23 10:49] <JimE_zOS> not our finest effort. 
[08/23 10:49] <JimE_zOS> and the army of *FMT modules.  Maybe a rethink there would have been good. 
[08/23 10:49] <JimE_zOS> still really cool code. 
[08/23 10:49] <dsk_hbe> yes, the one reason I was glad when CRE came along
[08/23 10:50] <02charlie> i think that was why cre came along
[08/23 10:50] <JimE_zOS> and we all know eclipse is WAY better than PQS. 
[08/23 10:51] <dsk_hbe> well, maybe partially Charlie, but making 8 LSAs do the work instead of a bunch more LSRs probably was at the top ;-)
[08/23 10:51] <dsk_hbe> and those darned EDGAR docs kept crashing users ;-)
[08/23 10:51] <dsk_hbe> that was probably at the top too ;-)
[08/23 10:51] <02charlie> yeah
[08/23 10:52] <06Amit_ZOS> wish i could relate to any of the above..lol
[08/23 10:53] <dsk_hbe> we will occasionally bore you with memory lane topics... fair wraning ;-)
[08/23 10:53] <06Amit_ZOS> fair enough
[08/23 10:54] <dsk_hbe> need to step outside for a few. brb
[08/23 10:58] <dsk_hbe> back
[08/23 11:15] <JimE_zOS> ready when U R, Amit. 
[08/23 11:15] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/23 11:15] <06Amit_ZOS> on my way
[08/23 11:15] <JimE_zOS> and let's talk team meeting. 
[08/23 11:15] <JimE_zOS> I have things to build for the copy change next week. 
[08/23 11:15] <JimE_zOS> so I don't have content for today's meeting. 
[08/23 11:15] <JimE_zOS> does anybody else have something they'd like to share? 
[08/23 11:15] <02charlie> yeah, i was trying to find my notes for what i was supposed to talk about
[08/23 11:16] <JimE_zOS> BCP 
[08/23 11:16] <dsk_hbe> yay... I have to leave right at 3 today
[08/23 11:16] <02charlie> ah, yes
[08/23 11:16] <dsk_hbe> I have nothing
[08/23 11:17] <02charlie> we can leave bcp to next time, or i can talk about it today, but with your build work do you still want to do that today?
[08/23 11:17] <JimE_zOS> I'd rather build.  I'm tight on time and long on complexity. 
[08/23 11:17] <02charlie> ok, then lets call off today's meeting
[08/23 11:18] <JimE_zOS> k....cancelling. 
[08/23 11:18] <JimE_zOS> done. 
[08/23 11:19] <JimE_zOS> walking to 155 to see a demo of my requested tool.  
[08/23 11:50] <dsk_hbe> done with Vickie's mtg... fyi they may look to do an MVS release early October.  They're building the list of changes now.  A big one will be fore negative news, but no surprise there
[08/23 11:51] <dsk_hbe> she's testing changes for w/s and w/p and has seen significant CPU savngs by including those in NN processing
[08/23 11:51] <02charlie> interesting

[08/23 17:05] <JimE_zOS> watching C1 start-up on SYSD, BTW. 
[08/23 17:05] <JimE_zOS> just to make sure I didn't break anything. 
[08/23 17:12] <02charlie> it appears to be good so far

[08/23 17:13] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[08/23 17:13] <JimE_zOS> I didn't expect trouble
[08/23 17:13] <JimE_zOS> but it never hurts to watch 
[08/23 17:14] <02charlie> indeed
[08/23 17:21] <02charlie> oh, btw, rather than re-code the stream i/o, i made a workaround by adding an extra record to the end of the file every time, so even when i get 1 record there will be two to read
[08/23 17:22] <02charlie> the extra record just gets discarded, becuase it doesnt have any appropriate data in it

[08/24 09:50] * ChanServ sets mode: +ao JimE_zOS JimE_zOS
[08/24 09:50] <JimE_zOS> howdy
[08/24 09:50] <dsk_hbe> hoya Jim
[08/24 09:50] <02charlie> morning jim
[08/24 09:50] <dsk_hbe> hiya... not a hoya
[08/24 09:51] <06Amit_zOS> Hola Jim! :P
[08/24 09:51] <JimE_zOS> I assumed that was the TX spelling. 
[08/24 09:51] <02charlie> i thought you meant hola!
[08/24 09:51] <06Amit_zOS> jinx
[08/24 09:51] <dsk_hbe> I shoudla left it alone to your own interpretations ;-)
[08/24 09:52] <06Amit_zOS> yes, neurons fire profusely in the mornings to come up with interpretations!
[08/24 09:52] <JimE_zOS> I"m only getting a word here and there, but I think Brian B is asking Doug how much would come off of the mainframe if we didn't have to update LDC/Rosetta content. 
[08/24 09:53] <dsk_hbe> woah
[08/24 09:53] <JimE_zOS> idiots are all around us. 
[08/24 09:53] <dsk_hbe> Briggs?
[08/24 09:53] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[08/24 09:53] <dsk_hbe> good grief
[08/24 09:53] <02charlie> and we would only be able to not update that content of all our ldc/rosetta users were migrated off those products
[08/24 09:54] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure he was put up to that (ie, I don't think he thinks that is a good idea) 
[08/24 09:54] <dsk_hbe> exactly and then Debbie retires ;-)
[08/24 09:54] <JimE_zOS> let's see if we can't stall that retirement date just a little longer. 
[08/24 09:54] <06Amit_zOS> what would the kids do if Debbie retires?!
[08/24 09:55] <dsk_hbe> you and Jim and probably Charlie woudl move on tot he wild LA frontier ;-)
[08/24 09:55] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure "T" could use her cat-like question asking skills to do something. 
[08/24 09:55] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. Id like to see them try move Jim to LA
[08/24 09:56] <dsk_hbe> I was day-dreaming this morning watchign the news, wondering what Jim woudl do with that money if he had beent eh powervall winner... buy the company... get it back to 'right'?
[08/24 09:57] <dsk_hbe> right = MVS rules
[08/24 10:00] <JimE_zOS> retire and then buy enough stock to force a vote of no confidence. 
[08/24 10:00] <JimE_zOS> heads would roll shortly thereafter. 
[08/24 10:00] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[08/24 10:00] <JimE_zOS> and, yes, I've given it some thought. 
[08/24 10:00] <06Amit_zOS> Just heard, "T" should start saving up for iPhone 8 releasing on September 12th!
[08/24 10:01] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/24 10:01] <JimE_zOS> oh, my yes.  How many will she buy at once? 
[08/24 10:15] <06Amit_zOS> no idea
[08/24 10:15] <06Amit_zOS> Debbie, fcards prepped and app scheduled
[08/24 10:15] <dsk_hbe> ok!
[08/24 10:17] <06Amit_zOS> One thing that i found was that the compare job did not catch both the changes i made.. (i think thats a code flaw of the job because both cards look the same after the change)
[08/24 10:17] <dsk_hbe> that's odd
[08/24 10:17] <06Amit_zOS> I mean the compare job caught one change, not the other
[08/24 10:18] <06Amit_zOS> Lemme know what you think
[08/24 10:19] <dsk_hbe> I checked the compare job and it looks fine to me, Amit.  I see both CTLRCR01 and CTLRCR03 showing changes
[08/24 10:20] <06Amit_zOS> yes.. i did the superc on both the datasets, and that shows me both the changes
[08/24 10:20] <dsk_hbe> I'm saying I checked the compare job you ran and it looks fine
[08/24 10:21] <06Amit_zOS> Yes, i understood that Debbie :)
[08/24 10:21] <dsk_hbe> ok, you've lost me then
[08/24 10:23] <06Amit_zOS> oh, i meant since the compare job didn't show me the result that i wanted to do, i ran a 3.12(superc or super compare) on the fcard members which showed me all the changes i made to the cards and that looked fine
[08/24 10:23] <dsk_hbe> and I'm saying the compare job does show you what you wanted
[08/24 10:23] <06Amit_zOS> ow
[08/24 10:24] <dsk_hbe> stop messing with my head... I've been awake since 4 for no good reason ;-)
[08/24 10:24] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/24 10:25] <02charlie> hey folks, today i'm going to run out for lunch today, and tomorrow i will be taking the relatives to the ariport in the morning (i'm not sure what time, i dont know if they have to be there at 0930 or their plane leaves at 0930), and then i have my dentists appointment in the afternoon
[08/24 10:25] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/24 10:26] <dsk_hbe> changes all look good, thanks, Amit!!
[08/24 10:28] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Debbie! I had not browsed by compare results properly
[08/24 10:28] <06Amit_zOS> got impatient
[08/24 10:28] <dsk_hbe> ah, I'm never impatient O;-)
[08/24 10:28] <06Amit_zOS> srry about that
[08/24 10:29] <dsk_hbe> well... not always anyway... close to it though ;-)
[08/24 10:30] <06Amit_zOS> Charlie, are you in B1?
[08/24 10:30] <02charlie> no
[08/24 10:30] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/24 10:31] <06Amit_zOS> they'r gonna shift me from my desk again... *sigh*
[08/24 10:31] <dsk_hbe> since you guys look at oddball ablines, Vickie has already looked at the DICSRV one and it's beause of this stupid-user search - (caps(417! or 41! or 4!7 or 17!) w/2 (consult! or (business! w/1 (dev! or assist! or advis! or advic! or strateg! or info! or plan! or analy! or anali! or manag! or organiz!)) or (strateg! and develop!)))
[08/24 10:31] <02charlie> :(
[08/24 10:31] <dsk_hbe> they are simpl asking too much of us ;-)
[08/24 10:31] <dsk_hbe> what the heck?  why are they moving you now???
[08/24 10:31] <JimE_zOS> need some steps and a splash of coffee.  Back shortly to start coding. 
[08/24 10:32] <06Amit_zOS> same reason as last time.. "grouping teams" apparently
[08/24 10:32] <dsk_hbe> at some point, Eric needs to just say no... I'd have thought that once was enough
[08/24 10:34] <triveni> brb

[08/24 10:57] <triveni> b
[08/24 11:11] <02charlie> hey debbie, what's the difference between EQQAUDIO and EQQADUIU?
[08/24 11:11] <dsk_hbe> the latter is for OPCU
[08/24 11:12] <dsk_hbe> which is where fab stuff runs I think... coudl be lying... been up since 4
[08/24 11:12] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/24 11:12] <06Amit_zOS> why were you up Debbie?
[08/24 11:13] <dsk_hbe> yep, my folder confirms... 'DB activity'
[08/24 11:13] <dsk_hbe> Amit, because the night *before* I was awoken by a chirping smoke detector and it doesn't take much to imprint on my sleep pattern.  See no good reason! 
[08/24 11:14] <02charlie> thx
[08/24 11:16] <dsk_hbe> ugh.... this nasty weather int eh gulf... heading straight for my aunt in Corpus Christi... they think it will land as a hurricane :-(
[08/24 11:37] <JimE_zOS> sorry to hear that, Debbie. 
[08/24 11:37] <JimE_zOS> I'll hope that it passes quickly and uneventfully for your aunt. 
[08/24 11:38] <dsk_hbe> thanks, I appreciate that
[08/24 11:42] <dsk_hbe> re: that email... that's what they get for not testing stuff still needed by internals :-/
[08/24 11:51] <02charlie> ok, i'm going to head to lunch

[08/24 12:01] <dsk_hbe> all this classic classic stuff... they're making me try to remember things I forgot a long time ago ;-)
[08/24 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> like Robert frost said.. miles to go before i sleep..and miles to go before i sleep
[08/24 12:01] <dsk_hbe> ;-)

[08/24 13:19] <triveni> I ll cheer for you all.. ;)
[08/24 13:19] <JimE_zOS> but just so you know....I left my 6-pack abs at home :-)

[08/24 13:37] <02charlie> no, we had more classmates there than we usually get when we have a reunio
[08/24 13:37] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[08/24 13:37] <02charlie> it might have been the free food, but the reason i want was because it was close (5 minutes from here or so)
[08/24 13:38] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[08/24 13:41] <02charlie> another good reason for not drivng to dayton today (meeting canceled)
[08/24 13:42] <dsk_hbe> I could give oyu lots more but you wouldn't listen to me ;-)
[08/24 13:42] <02charlie> lol
[08/24 13:42] <JimE_zOS> staff meeting should never be your reason to drive to campus. 
[08/24 13:42] <JimE_zOS> and I'm going to count that as a "jinx" 
[08/24 13:42] <dsk_hbe> yeah, yeah ;-)

[08/24 14:53] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/24 14:53] <02charlie> zzzzzz
[08/24 14:53] <06Amit_zOS> srry
[08/24 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> its an online training that Eric asked us if we'd be okay with that..
[08/24 14:55] <06Amit_zOS> but i think we don't see enough merit in spending 3k for training in these since we know enough about these
[08/24 14:55] <triveni> it seems like pretty basic topics..which v are already familliar with..and m not sure it will help with ss.
[08/24 14:55] <triveni> but still if something seems v should attend..tell us..
[08/24 15:00] <dsk_hbe> since no one really shares well around here (outside of us ;-), if you didn't hear what the root issue was on the recent UINFO critical incidents, details are in this problem ticket - PRB0019610
[08/24 15:04] <triveni> thanks debbie.. i saw a problem ticket first time.. it just didn't occur to me to notice them.. 
[08/24 15:04] <dsk_hbe> we resist them at all costs on this team ;-)
[08/24 15:04] <triveni> ok..so wen a major failure happens then v create problem ticket
[08/24 15:04] <triveni> is it?
[08/24 15:05] <triveni> like application is broken..
[08/24 15:05] <dsk_hbe> it's supposed to be the ITIL way, but I think it's hooey... don't tell anyone I said that ;-)
[08/24 15:06] <triveni> hahaa
[08/24 15:06] <triveni> okies :P
[08/24 15:09] <02charlie> nice tickett
[08/24 15:10] <dsk_hbe> I figured since you got paged, Charlie, you shoudl be honored with an explanation... communication around here... tsk...

[08/24 15:10] <02charlie> thx
[08/24 15:23] <dsk_hbe> sorry for not dropping you all from that email chain a long time ago... fwiw, I sent Anita JimC's firewall warning email... didn't want to share it with all those people sicne he's not here to ask if he minds.  Then she asks firewall the same time I send that to her ;-)
[08/24 15:23] <dsk_hbe> anywho... hopefully they get network to figure it out so they can stop emailing ;-)
[08/24 15:44] <dsk_hbe> enough of this for me.  Have a goodnight!

[08/25 09:58] <dsk_hbe> oh yay :-)
[08/25 09:59] <dsk_hbe> I am sure she is working herself into a frenzy at this very moment.  I don't have to participate int he frenzy until I get there in October
[08/25 09:59] <02charlie> lol
[08/25 10:00] <02charlie> the yyyyyy abends are because a db/gen got yaned from a user mid-browse
[08/25 10:00] <02charlie> yanked
[08/25 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> db/gen processes happen all the time right? then why dont these abends happen all the time?
[08/25 10:03] <06Amit_ZOS> when i go to India, in Jan, there will be 4 weddings for me to attend!
[08/25 10:04] <dsk_hbe> wow, non-stop party
[08/25 10:04] <06Amit_ZOS> Everyone's kind of aligning their weddings to my visit!
[08/25 10:04] <06Amit_ZOS> :P
[08/25 10:04] <dsk_hbe> that's nice of them to want you to be there
[08/25 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Well, more of a festivity than a party but a lot of fun regardless!
[08/25 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Yeah, close cousin brothers or their sisters.. all of them
[08/25 10:06] <triveni> brb
[08/25 10:08] <02charlie> nice
[08/25 10:10] <02charlie> and, yes, we have db events all the time, but to get the yyyyyy abend you have to be browsing a doc that is the db/gen that is the subject of a MKUN
[08/25 10:11] <02charlie> usually, this is the result (IIRC) of pulling up a saved search and browsing thru the docs. 
[08/25 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> ah i see..
[08/25 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> i assume we use the Aset server to save the searches right? 
[08/25 10:14] <02charlie> i'm guessing probably so
[08/25 10:15] * triveni has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[08/25 10:17] <06Amit_ZOS> here is what im thinking: if you store the aset, im assuming it expires within a fixed amount of time. And if we knew, about how long until the DB's the aset uses being MKUN'd, we could have warned the guy right?
[08/25 10:17] <02charlie> debbie might know more, btw
[08/25 10:17] <02charlie> the aset may last longer (eg 30 days) than the DB/gen
[08/25 10:18] <02charlie> and i think when you pull the stored answer set up, it will check the docs again
[08/25 10:18] <dsk_hbe> yeah it lasts a while.  I'll find one to show you, sec
[08/25 10:19] <02charlie> but if it has already checked the validity of the answer set, and then while you're looking at it, the db/gen gets mkun-ed, there's not much we can do but kill the transaction
[08/25 10:19] <dsk_hbe> go here - http://ta.lexis-nexis.com/ta/html/aset/asetHandleUnMangler.html  and enter this aset to have it unmangle for you - D-WA-A-A-A-MsSAYWC-UUA-UZEZVVUAA-U-U-U-U-U-W-ACUZWWYZAB-ACUBYUEVAB-ZADDCUCYC-U-U
[08/25 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> ah, so when the guy pulls the stored Aset, we check the validity of the answer set!!!
[08/25 10:20] <dsk_hbe> You'll see it's created yesterday but won't expire until 9/23 
[08/25 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> almost a month!
[08/25 10:21] <dsk_hbe> however, there is this extra date - The Answers for this Answer Set will be DELETED on: 08/26/17 (Sat) at 00:00
[08/25 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> but when he checks for it the last day, what are the chances that the aset is valid
[08/25 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> ?
[08/25 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> not much right?
[08/25 10:22] <dsk_hbe> so I may be lying but I think this suggests any attempt to use that aset after that date means we run a refresh (new search basically), so shodul get latest gens.
[08/25 10:22] <02charlie> (Rule 1) :D
[08/25 10:23] <dsk_hbe> oh no, we turn over gens so quickly on so many bases that a refresh is really the best hope.
[08/25 10:24] <dsk_hbe> I think I had a conversation with Anita about this before.  Will see if Ic an find it... but I think some products autimatically do soemthign smart to get the user the doc from the latest gen and some still don't.
[08/25 10:25] * triveni has joined #theRock
[08/25 10:25] <triveni> b
[08/25 10:25] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. so what i understand is, if the aset is valid when the guy pulls it up, it will get him what he needs, else if it invalid, it can do the search again and get him what he needs
[08/25 10:26] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh btw Debbie, how did you sleep yesterday!?
[08/25 10:27] <dsk_hbe> much better... the imprint must have only lasted one night ;-)  but I woke up with a killer headache.  Trying to decide if thsi is due to the weather churning or the new allergy med my doc started me on
[08/25 10:28] <06Amit_ZOS> ah.. I have a pollen allergy too.. dust.. i get asthmatic if exposed prolongly
[08/25 10:29] <dsk_hbe> never used to be bothered by anything... I guess it's common to start getting them as you get older

[08/25 10:31] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[08/25 10:32] <02charlie> morning jim
[08/25 10:32] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[08/25 10:32] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I'm not finding that converation email with Anita.  I'll look more in a bit
[08/25 10:32] <02charlie> btw, just wanted to remind everyone, i have a dental appt at 1 today, and next week (along with debbie) i'll be out thurs & fri
[08/25 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh, i will be asking Anita anyway Debbie..
[08/25 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> she is going to have a session for retrievals soon
[08/25 10:33] <dsk_hbe> ok!
[08/25 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks a lot though! :)
[08/25 10:33] <dsk_hbe> Wow, Charlie... how do we keep doing this?
[08/25 10:34] <02charlie> talented :D
[08/25 10:34] <06Amit_ZOS> hey Jim! :)
[08/25 10:34] <JimE_zOS> next week is going to be an adventure. 
[08/25 10:34] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I think there is actually a ticket open on the product that I'm thnking doesn't behave well, but it's not gettign through my headache.  Caffeine isn't helping yet so I'll seek Tylenol soon
[08/25 10:34] <JimE_zOS> assuming I can get an approved change, I hope to implement Bridge 2.0 next week. 
[08/25 10:35] <06Amit_ZOS> Wohoo!
[08/25 10:35] <JimE_zOS> so I'll be up watching/changing/fixing bridge stuff all week long. 
[08/25 10:35] <02charlie> oh, that will be interesting
[08/25 10:35] <JimE_zOS> plus, the FG -> BG change is scheduled (assuming approved) for next Thursday 
[08/25 10:35] <06Amit_ZOS> nice!
[08/25 10:35] <02charlie> what's bridge 2.0 going to do?
[08/25 10:36] <dsk_hbe> I was gonna say I didn't see your entry in the calendar back when I added mine, Charlie, and I still don't... I see this instead ;-)
[08/25 10:36] <dsk_hbe> DSK | 08/31 - 09/01      | PTO - 2 | CLE in Covington. Pagable and may be online.
[08/25 10:36] <dsk_hbe> Debbie will not be taking continuing legal education training ;-)
[08/25 10:36] <02charlie> lol
[08/25 10:36] <02charlie> thx
[08/25 10:36] <JimE_zOS> the high level benefits are in the change, Charlie.  Allow me to paste:
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> With this change, Bridge 2.0 will:
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - allow more flexibility in OLS configuration
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - eliminate the need to make matching Console Automation changes when the OLS configuration changes
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - eliminate large swings in available capacity and reductions in parallelism
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - eliminate the need for OPS to control CRIT/COLD (override provided) 
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - eliminate the need for OPS to manually start copies (Wave 1 eliminated) 
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - improve ability to recover from bridge automation failures by eliminating current time restrictions  
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - enhance our ability to apply and remove zaps
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - enhance our ability to apply and remove mainframe releases  
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - reduce the time needed for a metadata fallback
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - provide an automated "bounce the house" facility 
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - reduce the impact of bad environmental changes by providing a "parachute" facility 
[08/25 10:37] <02charlie> you might try it debbie :)
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - provide a copy control facility which can be used during BCP tests and podded MVS releases 
[08/25 10:37] <JimE_zOS> - reduce our LFD copy footprint (with a corresponding simplification to the QLRB matrix) through enhanced copy re-use 
[08/25 10:38] <dsk_hbe> not even a little interest, Charlie
[08/25 10:38] <02charlie> nice, i like that, jim
[08/25 10:39] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome!
[08/25 10:39] <JimE_zOS> to quote Amit, I have "miles to go" before that is all in place. 
[08/25 10:41] <02charlie> [07/31 11:33] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I'm going to request 8/31 and 9/1... Charlie beat me to those dates so I emailed Jim to see if he minded being left with just the 3 of you again.  Since I don't expect a reply while he shodul be vacationing I will go ahead and make the formal requests and can always change them later if it s a probelm for him.
[08/25 10:42] <dsk_hbe> yet I got them into the calendar first and it wins ;-)
[08/25 10:42] <triveni> we will wait for an detailed session Jim.
[08/25 10:43] <02charlie> true :D
[08/25 10:43] <triveni> whenever u get time.
[08/25 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> Gosh, Jim quoting me, who'd have thought the day would come! Thanks you for this high honor!
[08/25 10:43] <02charlie> lol
[08/25 10:43] <02charlie> i think you probably have the official pto request in too before me
[08/25 10:44] <02charlie> since i dont think ve done that yet
[08/25 10:44] <dsk_hbe> I do, yes... I wn, I win ;-p
[08/25 10:44] <JimE_zOS> :-)
[08/25 10:45] <JimE_zOS> it is really OK for you both to be gone.  I really don't mind. 
[08/25 10:45] <dsk_hbe> in other words, he will enjoy the solitude so he can THINK! ;-)
[08/25 10:45] <02charlie> lol
[08/25 10:45] <06Amit_ZOS> Yeah, i might do some spontaneous PTO's in september.. feeling the urge to head to the west coast
[08/25 10:46] <JimE_zOS> maybe you should build an app to send "T" your mileage, Amit. 
[08/25 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> oh, not completely.. do not forget the TA!
[08/25 10:46] <JimE_zOS> you know...so she can stay updated. 
[08/25 10:46] <02charlie> lol
[08/25 10:46] <JimE_zOS> I do have lots of thinking to do. 
[08/25 10:46] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. good idea, maybe i can send that to one of her apple devices (R)
[08/25 10:47] <JimE_zOS> better start with a splash of "Einstein Water".  BRB 
[08/25 10:48] <02charlie> Einstein was a genuis, but his brother Frank was a monster :D
[08/25 10:52] <dsk_hbe> that tractor picture is hilarious!!!!
[08/25 10:57] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/25 11:05] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[08/25 11:17] <JimE_zOS> k, Doug has been briefed RE: Bridge 2.0 and my planned changes to CRIT and COLD. 
[08/25 11:17] <JimE_zOS> (our gentlemen's agreement requires that I discuss COLD changes with him before implementation)
[08/25 11:18] <JimE_zOS> and, to be clear, I'll hold all mayhem until my oncall week starts. 
[08/25 11:28] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, we are moving WRE to Oxford tonight.  I might leave a little early just so I can get home at a reasonable hour. 
[08/25 11:28] <JimE_zOS> this won't be a long night...we've already moved most of his stuff. 
[08/25 11:29] <dsk_hbe> thanks, hope it goes smoothly
[08/25 11:29] <JimE_zOS> his is just for the last few big things.  Bed, dresser, etc

[08/28 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome, one of the latest addition to my to-learn list is the southern accent! ;-)
[08/28 09:42] <triveni> gm debbie
[08/28 09:42] <dsk_hbe> well, y'all are doin' just dandy ;-)
[08/28 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/28 09:43] <dsk_hbe> we golfed in a couples scramble a couple weeks ago and the couple we were with were definitley southern raised.  I can't help but start talking more southern when I'm around folks like that.  It drives my husband crazy ;-)
[08/28 09:43] <02charlie> btw, i'm looking at the se99 jobs in error
[08/28 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> you should listen to the song called "Southern girl" by Tim McGraw.. i LOVE it!

[08/28 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> critical renames didnt go through in fabc?
[08/28 09:48] <dsk_hbe> are you asking about my page this weekend?
[08/28 09:48] <dsk_hbe> it was prod for the lxevol rename, but we got it moving.  writing my turnover note now with details
[08/28 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> i think he is talking about what happend today morning?
[08/28 09:49] <dsk_hbe> and that ticket we just got... that needs to go to someone else... do you rememebr the person's name, Charlie?
[08/28 09:49] <dsk_hbe> he who, Amit?
[08/28 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> an RC of 0001-- a warning or error? he=charlie
[08/28 09:50] <dsk_hbe> oh Doug's note?  haven't read it yet... but my guess is it's related to the whole oracle upgrade
[08/28 09:50] <02charlie> it is 
[08/28 09:50] <dsk_hbe> oic... I missed Charlie's comment above... ok, back to my note
[08/28 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> i was just looking at the error list today when charlie said that se99 jobs were in error
[08/28 09:51] <02charlie> and i made the changes in the jobs, i need to make the same changes to the real jcl
[08/28 09:51] <02charlie> doug is not completely correct in his note
[08/28 09:51] <02charlie> but mostly so :)
[08/28 09:51] <dsk_hbe> if we have teh luxury to wait, I'd wait until Jim is around to think about FABC.  he is more on top of what is happening with that stuff than even the people doing it, sadly :-(
[08/28 09:52] <02charlie> and i'm going to have to see it i can find the name, debbie
[08/28 09:53] <dsk_hbe> found it!  Seralathan, Prashanth 
[08/28 09:53] <02charlie> that's a kevin z graph, isnt it?
[08/28 09:53] <dsk_hbe> yep, thus I think that guy needs to be the starting point... Gordon told us he owns it
[08/28 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> Prashanth was an intern here
[08/28 09:54] <dsk_hbe> was?  
[08/28 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, he finished his internship and headed back to Buffalo couple of weeks ago
[08/28 09:55] <dsk_hbe> well Gordon needs to find who the new owner is then... it ain't us!
[08/28 09:55] <triveni> brb
[08/28 09:55] <02charlie> terry ison then
[08/28 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> okay, i need to catch up on mails to get some context here
[08/28 09:56] <02charlie> and  prashanth was here on 8/11, when he sent his email
[08/28 09:57] <dsk_hbe> no longer in address book
[08/28 09:57] <02charlie> nice
[08/28 09:57] <02charlie> then i'd sent it to terry
[08/28 09:57] <02charlie> send

[08/28 10:49] <dsk_hbe> hoya Jim
[08/28 10:49] <dsk_hbe> sigh
[08/28 10:49] <02charlie> monring jim
[08/28 10:50] <02charlie> i have rita peters and rajesh iyer lyncing me about the fabc oracle changes
[08/28 10:51] <02charlie> looks like the following forma have the old java version hardcoded
[08/28 10:51] <02charlie> ROSE$SDS
[08/28 10:51] <02charlie> ROSE$MDT

[08/28 10:51] <02charlie> forms
[08/28 10:52] <02charlie> which has been causing the SE99* application failures
[08/28 10:54] <triveni> can i see these forms via opc
[08/28 10:55] <02charlie> i can fix the JCL in the CP, and get the application to finish, but do we want to just change the jcl in the forms library, or turn the java version into a variable?
[08/28 10:55] <02charlie> the forms are in PT00.OPCA.OLMR.SKLLIB
[08/28 10:55] <triveni> yeah i found them there
[08/28 10:55] <JimE_zOS> sorry...Amit. 
[08/28 10:55] <JimE_zOS> I've already spoken to Doug RE: SDS/Rosetta, Charlie 
[08/28 10:56] <02charlie> ah, ok
[08/28 10:56] <JimE_zOS> I'd rather fix those myself. 
[08/28 10:56] <JimE_zOS> because I suspect there will be many more. 
[08/28 10:56] <triveni> but i want to watch
[08/28 10:56] <triveni> jim
[08/28 10:56] <JimE_zOS> and I want to know what to change. 
[08/28 10:56] <triveni> please involve us
[08/28 10:56] <triveni> too
[08/28 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> back
[08/28 10:56] <02charlie> yeah, doug has sent his list of suspect jobs i his most recent email
[08/28 10:56] <02charlie> in his
[08/28 10:58] <02charlie> so do you want me to leave the application in error for now?
[08/28 11:00] <JimE_zOS> yes, please. 
[08/28 11:00] <JimE_zOS> did somebody already fix one of the failed jobs? 
[08/28 11:06] <02charlie> yes, but only in the CP
[08/28 11:11] <dsk_hbe> That ticket on Kevin's report is still in our queue.  I'm gonna go ahead and ship it off.
[08/28 11:12] <dsk_hbe> oh Jim took it?
[08/28 11:12] <dsk_hbe> please tell me we aren't taking ownership of that, Jim?
[08/28 11:19] <triveni> Thanks Jim.. i can see the fresh job run in spool and it also took the new java version values.. :)
[08/28 11:20] <JimE_zOS> we aren't, Debbie. 
[08/28 11:20] <JimE_zOS> I grabbed it to keep somebody from working on it. 
[08/28 11:20] <JimE_zOS> if you are ready to ship it off, by all means, please. 
[08/28 11:21] <dsk_hbe> good!  Will do!!!
[08/28 11:21] <triveni> i can ship it off
[08/28 11:21] <triveni> debbie
[08/28 11:21] <triveni> just tell me the group name
[08/28 11:21] <JimE_zOS> let's put some comments in there about why we don't own that, please. 
[08/28 11:22] <JimE_zOS> ie, it isn't just out of our queue that I want, it is "hell no" that I'm hoping to get. 
[08/28 11:22] <dsk_hbe> I don't knwo the group name... I was just going to send it back to OPS and tell them to give it to whatever group Terry Ison is in... since Prashanth is now gone... can you do that and forcefully say hell no without saying ''hell" ;-)
[08/28 11:23] <dsk_hbe> And terry is just a guess on Charlie's part, but I suspect a good one
[08/28 11:23] <dsk_hbe> if you'd prefer I do it, Triveni, let me know
[08/28 11:24] <triveni> i can try writting something
[08/28 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> getting something to eat..
[08/28 11:27] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/28 11:30] <triveni> production support L1.. i am routing it to them
[08/28 11:30] <dsk_hbe> yes, thanks
[08/28 11:31] <triveni> :)
[08/28 11:38] <JimE_zOS> I think "Terry" Ison is Tracy Ison and that would be MSP 
[08/28 11:38] <dsk_hbe> good grief... Charlie, you led me astray ;-)
[08/28 11:39] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I've left the other SDS/Rosetta JCL alone 
[08/28 11:39] <02charlie> lmc
[08/28 11:39] <dsk_hbe> I still jhave not met her... I need to be sure to do that next time I am on campus.  Maybe that will make me remember who she is better
[08/28 11:39] <JimE_zOS> so that I can walk A&T through a fix. 
[08/28 11:40] <02charlie> tracy, sheesh
[08/28 11:40] <JimE_zOS> she isn't going to fix it either, BTW 
[08/28 11:40] <02charlie> sorry
[08/28 11:40] <dsk_hbe> I first read that as AT&T and was impressed you were going to help my stupid phone company fix itself ;-)
[08/28 11:40] <02charlie> rotflmao
[08/28 11:40] <JimE_zOS> in the next life, perhaps. 
[08/28 11:41] <JimE_zOS> Tracy has already had these complaints from Brian B. 
[08/28 11:41] <JimE_zOS> what Kevin built is simply not supported. 
[08/28 11:41] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, he uses the same graphing doesn't he
[08/28 11:41] <02charlie> well, im just now drinking my first cup of the magic elixir
[08/28 11:41] <JimE_zOS> I see a time in the very near future when it will just be taken down. 
[08/28 11:42] <02charlie> nice little graphs tho
[08/28 11:42] <dsk_hbe> that Seralathan, Prashanth guy that was involved last time Gordon tried to get us to fix his tool is now gone (thanks, Amit!), but surely someone else took over... hahaha... I make me laugh...
[08/28 11:42] <02charlie> lol
[08/28 11:44] <triveni> we had some training sessions with tracy. Bob portman was teaching us REXX.
[08/28 11:45] <triveni> and prashanth was the new intern. he even helped me move to my new place. helped with the shifting.. ;) he left last to last week. I cooked for him as a partying gift. ehehe 
[08/28 11:46] <dsk_hbe> see you guys know things we don't! ;-)
[08/28 11:46] <triveni> ;)
[08/28 11:50] <JimE_zOS> way late in getting my splash of coffee.  BRB 
[08/28 11:59] <JimE_zOS> back 
[08/28 12:07] <triveni> will get something to eat.. brb.. i have my phone with me..

[08/28 12:35] <triveni> ;)
[08/28 12:36] <dsk_hbe> ok, this is um... weird... I had that ID stored in my job already from looking at him last week... allow me to go look at my last week notes ;-)
[08/28 12:38] <dsk_hbe> not in my notes... I haven't a clue why I had him in there :-/
[08/28 12:38] <dsk_hbe> sheesh... you're not Wayne ;-)
[08/28 12:39] <02charlie> lol
[08/28 12:46] <Amit_away> back
[08/28 12:46] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[08/28 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> Debbie, do we need those scripts fixed too?
[08/28 12:54] <dsk_hbe> I use chksig a lot but out of this casenet directory which is somethign the middleware folks set up, so nothign for us to change... hopefully Ed will fix them for us
[08/28 12:54] <dsk_hbe> er, chkdig
[08/28 13:06] <triveni> i am trying to use that command debbie.
[08/28 13:06] <triveni> it says command not found
[08/28 13:07] <triveni> [tpx898:/home/tpf816/ss/bin] 50 % chkdig 13W14Z
[08/28 13:07] <dsk_hbe> you have to have ~ss/bin in your path
[08/28 13:07] <triveni> am i doing anything wrong
[08/28 13:08] <dsk_hbe> sorry, let me finish what I am working on and then I can show you what you need
[08/28 13:08] <06Amit_zOS> it says the same as yours does: Enter user-name: SP2-0306: Invalid option.
[08/28 13:08] <triveni> ok
[08/28 13:09] <06Amit_zOS> type "/home/tpf816/ss/bin/chkdig NFXG8K" without quotes
[08/28 13:09] <triveni> got it
[08/28 13:10] <dsk_hbe> waiting on a job... to avoid the full path, add it to your path in your .cshrc like this:
[08/28 13:10] <dsk_hbe> set path = (~/bin /usr/bin /usr/ucb /usr/local /serve/gemacs/bin /serve/3270 /serve/wp4.2/bin /usr/etc /usr/sbin /opt/ssh/bin ~ss/bin .)
[08/28 13:11] <dsk_hbe> it being ~ss/bin
[08/28 13:11] <triveni> ok
[08/28 13:12] <06Amit_zOS> oh i just added it as an alias.. are there other commands in that directory that we are likely to use?
[08/28 13:13] <dsk_hbe> that'll work too... I thinkt he only other one I have used at all recently is getpw... it is very handy for when you forget your web product password... it will give you an encrypted version of your password that will get you signed in and then you can change your password to something you won't forget once signed in ;-)
[08/28 13:13] <dsk_hbe> I used to use checkBgrp but it has been broken a logn time.  I'm sure  reported it to JimC but he may not have had time to look at it
[08/28 13:15] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/28 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> btw, the CRESRD+0004C abends are the results of the issue you mentioned in your turnover note regarding the LCRE isssues right?
[08/28 13:23] <06Amit_zOS> @Debbie
[08/28 13:24] <dsk_hbe> I still want to confirm but I think they may have been... and if so, that doesn't make me happy
[08/28 13:24] <06Amit_zOS> I see
[08/28 13:24] <dsk_hbe> what is odd though is that they stopped around 6am... though possibly not odd since that is when chasm stopped bouncing... quite the mess with that ring business
[08/28 13:25] <02charlie> yeah, and i was concerned that it seemed both copies of J1 and J9 seemed to be processing work
[08/28 13:26] <06Amit_zOS> also, early morning jitters today?:

[08/28 13:26] <02charlie> i meant to save off copies of the diaries, but didnt :(
[08/28 13:26] <02charlie> and we had a mess in the LCRE on 8/26 too
[08/28 13:26] <dsk_hbe> I thinkt he diaries would all be grabbed, right?  I mean so they show up in the daily diary
[08/28 13:31] <02charlie> wow, i dont think ive ever seen a code 25 abend for an LCRE abend
[08/28 13:36] <06Amit_zOS> mine is still not working yet.. do i need to logout and login again?
[08/28 13:36] <06Amit_zOS> (chkdig)
[08/28 13:36] <dsk_hbe> he has a test version - chkdig12
[08/28 13:37] <dsk_hbe> I assume he'll move it into the official name now that we've checked it out
[08/28 13:37] <06Amit_zOS> o'right then.. i will wait
[08/28 13:59] <06Amit_zOS> i cant get to ldc cert
[08/28 13:59] <06Amit_zOS> url not even loading for me
[08/28 13:59] <dsk_hbe> what url?
[08/28 14:00] <06Amit_zOS> https://cert-grp5.lexis.com/research/
[08/28 14:02] <dsk_hbe> I tried a couple other CDCs and they aren't working either.  Might try asking about it on #cos and see if Ed or Dean can look
[08/28 14:03] <dsk_hbe> also, I wonder if Bobbie has noticed yet.  She uses cdc5 for metadata checkout.  Lets see if she put in a ticket
[08/28 14:22] <triveni> debbie.. was going through ur turnover notes.. i wanted to know which team takes care of chasm issues. 
[08/28 14:22] <triveni> where u able to drop a ticket to them..

[08/29 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> 5P9X-KGV1-F04D-122H-00000-00 is indeed a bad doc like debbie suggested
[08/29 10:01] <dsk_hbe> is it pure ugly?
[08/29 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> its irretrievable

[08/29 10:03] <02charlie> good morning debbie
[08/29 10:04] <dsk_hbe> yeah, likely got the same abline Charlie was reporting.  I have to wonder if it's just that lcre is a little more tolerant of the tight loops than MVS is, since Charlie said he hasn't seen code 25's before now

[08/29 11:41] <dsk_hbe> hey Charlie, I forget a lot about CLassic browse, but when you displayed that doc in Classic, did you display the whole doc, i.e. page through tot he end?  Seems we used to have issues but you didn't know where int he doc the issues were until you paged through
[08/29 11:41] <02charlie> i didnt page all the way through, i would probably have spent all day doing that :)
[08/29 11:42] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... yeah... try a print?
[08/29 11:42] <02charlie> teh serprt has  243K records
[08/29 11:42] <dsk_hbe> let the OLS page for you ;-)
[08/29 11:42] <02charlie> lol
[08/29 11:42] <02charlie> i dont think i remember the rpint command
[08/29 11:42] <dsk_hbe> um... sec... I must find my book ;-)
[08/29 11:44] <dsk_hbe> my book was useless... I think it is .pr for print doc and .mi for mailit
[08/29 11:44] <dsk_hbe> I coudl be lying
[08/29 11:44] <02charlie> i and i could try it :)

[08/29 11:48] <02charlie> classic rules!
[08/29 11:48] <02charlie> yeah
[08/29 11:48] <dsk_hbe> she really is?
[08/29 11:48] <02charlie> we got a call, the familty that is hosting her wants to send to back
[08/29 11:48] <dsk_hbe> hosting your granddaughter?
[08/29 11:49] <02charlie> fran & family moved to VA in february, annette and jeremy were hosting o'bryen so that she could graduate from HS this year
[08/29 11:49] <dsk_hbe> while I try to absorb that... a thought... can you do that print as an attached print?  Forgetting what I ever knew abotu classic it may be that job type XA isn't fully rendered
[08/29 11:50] <dsk_hbe> oh my... 
[08/29 11:50] <02charlie> how do i do an attached print?
[08/29 11:50] <dsk_hbe> you're making me find old brain cells ;-)  sec ;-)
[08/29 11:50] <02charlie> lol
[08/29 11:51] <06Amit_ZOS> lunch
[08/29 11:51] <dsk_hbe> choose this option under .pr Charlie:
[08/29 11:51] <dsk_hbe> 1.   Defer documents until you sign on again.
[08/29 11:51] <dsk_hbe>      (Deferred document delivery is saved for 24 hours)
[08/29 11:53] <02charlie> i think it's remembering my choice and i cant seem to find an option to change it back
[08/29 11:53] <dsk_hbe> you probably have to sign out and back in
[08/29 11:54] <02charlie> you were right
[08/29 11:54] <dsk_hbe> meanwhile, your other print has left pcs hcp to who knows where ;-)
[08/29 11:54] <02charlie> twice, now :)
[08/29 11:54] <02charlie> -->  You have confirmed your document delivery order.
[08/29 11:54] <02charlie> now do i sign off and sign back in again?
[08/29 11:55] <dsk_hbe> well, teh sign iback in again piece woudl have to be on the session manager software to actually deliver it, but I think just by requesting it this way, the formatting is done in the LSA
[08/29 11:55] <02charlie> ah
[08/29 11:56] * charlie is now known as Not_the_droid_youre_seeking
[08/29 11:56] * Not_the_droid_youre_seeking is now known as charlie
[08/29 12:03] <dsk_hbe> have you signed off fabc yet, Charlie?  THere is a command to make your print close otu without signing off but I don't remember what it is ;-)
[08/29 12:03] <02charlie> no
[08/29 12:03] <02charlie> lmc
[08/29 12:04] <02charlie> when i sign off, the only thing it asks is if i want to save my search
[08/29 12:04] <02charlie> now im signed off
[08/29 12:04] <dsk_hbe> yeah, but it releases the print doc to process, kinda... still won't deliver until you find some old session manager software that you can't log into anyway per that crazy email conversation ;-)
[08/29 12:05] <02charlie> rotflmao
[08/29 12:05] <dsk_hbe> ok, mind if I cancel your job now that it has processed and routed to PCS?  Then I can peek at part of it in archive and see if it looks happy
[08/29 12:05] <02charlie> yes, ma'am
[08/29 12:06] <02charlie> i'd like to know how to peek too :)
[08/29 12:06] <dsk_hbe> 1 DOCUMENT PRINTED
[08/29 12:06] <dsk_hbe> 685 PRINTED PAGES

[08/29 12:06] <dsk_hbe> oh sure!  when you sign into FABC, do you get the gateway screen?  IF so, choose HCP there

[08/29 12:09] <dsk_hbe> then v 1 to see your formatted print doc... note it will only show you the top portion, but that is enough to see that it was successful
[08/29 12:09] <dsk_hbe> and classic rules
[08/29 12:09] <dsk_hbe> oh and .np gets your through the amount you can see
[08/29 12:09] <02charlie> yeah, i was hopin there was an .lp command :D
[08/29 12:09] <dsk_hbe> ??
[08/29 12:10] <dsk_hbe> oh, last page?  hahaha, nope ;-)
[08/29 12:10] <dsk_hbe> but the fact that it says at the top that it formatted 685 pages suggests good things.
[08/29 12:10] <02charlie> if i could remember the f-key assignments, i would page thru using that
[08/29 12:10] <dsk_hbe> f1 for .np
[08/29 12:10] <02charlie> .np for every next page is way too cumbersome
[08/29 12:11] <02charlie> f2 for .pp?
[08/29 12:11] <dsk_hbe> um, maybe ;-)  yeah I think so... then f3 for next doc, etc.
[08/29 12:11] <02charlie> ah thx
[08/29 12:11] <dsk_hbe> I'd have to grab that book to tell you the rest ;-)
[08/29 12:11] <02charlie> dont grab a book :D
[08/29 12:11] <02charlie> WAY too much work :D
[08/29 12:12] <dsk_hbe> but I think this print is enough to say we fully formatted it and were happy... and classic rules
[08/29 12:12] <02charlie> yeah, indeed!
[08/29 12:12] <dsk_hbe> btw, you will note that archive won't let you look at those XA job types... they're on some ugly format until they get processed by QDS
[08/29 12:12] <triveni_brb> b
[08/29 12:12] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[08/29 12:13] <02charlie> well, now that you mentioned that, i had to try it ;) 
[08/29 12:13] <02charlie> XA-type jobs are not viewable.
[08/29 12:13] <dsk_hbe> I just knew you would ;-)

[08/29 12:42] <02charlie> hi jim, late night/early moning i see
[08/29 12:42] <JimE_zOS> sorry to be so slow this AM.  Up till 4:30 working on rosetta renames and code. 
[08/29 12:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Hi Jim! :)
[08/29 12:42] <JimE_zOS> gonna be late all week. 
[08/29 12:42] <02charlie> figured as much with what's on your plate for the bridge
[08/29 12:43] <JimE_zOS> yep....and having to divert for SDS made a mess out of last night. 
[08/29 12:43] <JimE_zOS> I held all critical renames until the SDS part finished. 
[08/29 12:43] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim... what a night :-(
[08/29 12:44] <JimE_zOS> cause I wasn't sure it was giong to work and I didn't want to have to do a metadata fallback. 
[08/29 12:44] <JimE_zOS> so, held everything, let SDS/Rosetta run, then released all of the renames. 
[08/29 12:49] <dsk_hbe> It is really getting exhausting trying to figure otu all of Gordon's lame stats ;-)  You are definitely correct, Charlie... two copies per LCRE bridge

[08/29 13:14] <JimE_zOS> my cable modem thinks I am. 
[08/29 13:14] <06Amit_ZOS> didnt know you left!
[08/29 13:14] <dsk_hbe> see now, I was trying to remember why I knew that ID... good memory.  He was saved in one of my jobs and I coduln't recall why!
[08/29 13:14] <dsk_hbe> why are you having so many internet probelms Jim?  what a pain!
[08/29 13:15] <JimE_zOS> not sure, Debbie. 
[08/29 13:15] <JimE_zOS> but it worries me. 
[08/29 13:15] <dsk_hbe> you tell them JIm!!!! (re: your email)
[08/29 13:15] <dsk_hbe> I bet it does :-(
[08/29 13:20] <02charlie> ::sigh::
[08/29 13:20] <02charlie> the oracle/metadata issues and gordon
[08/29 13:23] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, Charlie, I am not goign to share with him what happened during my oncall weekend because he will drive it intot he ground before I even have a chance to play out the investigation.  So I'm staying silent for now
[08/29 13:23] <02charlie> sure
[08/29 13:24] <dsk_hbe> and his data source is so suspect... why in the world is it our job to explain his stats
[08/29 13:25] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/29 13:25] <dsk_hbe> sorry to be so negative in fron of you kids, but he wears me out!!!!
[08/29 13:26] <02charlie> and i see where he created the ticket for the graphing not working that we got monday
[08/29 13:26] <dsk_hbe> yep
[08/29 13:27] <02charlie> sheesh
[08/29 13:27] <dsk_hbe> you spent a really long time trying to help him with that last time... also ended up not being our probelm
[08/29 13:27] <JimE_zOS> I've told him before that we neither own nor support that graphing app. 
[08/29 13:28] <dsk_hbe> I guess to be fair, OPS sent that to us, not GOrdon, but he sure didn't suggest where to send it... and after that last go round he certainly knew it wasn't us and had other names involved to fix it before
[08/29 13:30] <JimE_zOS> yeah, but if here weren't pooping out problems for somebody else to find/fix, life would sure be better. 
[08/29 13:30] <dsk_hbe> goodness yes
[08/29 13:30] <JimE_zOS> just so you know, I'm considering canceling renames tonight. 
[08/29 13:31] <dsk_hbe> I do't know how int he world you got through them last night :-(
[08/29 13:31] <02charlie> yeah, but he used the psc1875 ci that routes to us
[08/29 13:31] <JimE_zOS> I'll give the metadata tools folks some time to respond, but we are not in a good place. 
[08/29 13:31] <02charlie> probably a good idea until we get the java and envirnomental variables issues settled
[08/29 13:32] <06Amit_ZOS> i need a walk around the campus..

[08/29 13:34] <dsk_hbe> poor Jim :-(
[08/29 13:47] <JimE_zOS> why is "temp-delete" the first solution suggested? 
[08/29 13:48] <02charlie> maybe because i suggested that in the first instance?
[08/29 13:48] <JimE_zOS> as a means of limiting customer impact, fine. 
[08/29 13:49] <JimE_zOS> but the data people always seem to stop after "temp-delete"
[08/29 13:49] <JimE_zOS> block a bad doc..sure. 
[08/29 13:49] <JimE_zOS> but then FIX it.
[08/29 13:49] <JimE_zOS> the FIX it part always seems to be lacking. 
[08/29 13:50] <02charlie> you took the words out of my keyboard :)

[08/29 13:53] <06Amit_zOS> b
[08/29 13:57] <dsk_hbe> hey Charlie, in case Gordon keeps bugging you, G# and G4, the failover copies that are runnign, are controlled by that bridge#2 he si complainign about.  Maybe his stats don't like a low use copy and he needs to address that all by his lonesome.
[08/29 13:57] <dsk_hbe> ahem, G3 and G4
[08/29 13:58] <02charlie> :) i speak irc :)
[08/29 13:58] <02charlie> thx
[08/29 13:58] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/29 14:06] <06Amit_zOS> hey charlie, we could possibly use the DB 1CZ0 issue as a training case study with Anita, would you mind if I share the info with her?
[08/29 14:06] <02charlie> sure
[08/29 14:07] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks
[08/29 14:12] <dsk_hbe> ha, I can see you typing a reply to Gordon now, Charlie ;-)  boy he just doesn't give up
[08/29 14:17] <02charlie> ok, was that snarky enough :)
[08/29 14:17] <02charlie> ?
[08/29 14:17] <dsk_hbe> that'll do ;-)
[08/29 14:18] <02charlie> i cut copied and pasted what i had previously cut and pasted into the same email :)
[08/29 14:22] <JimE_zOS> I'm not on this thread, am I?  
[08/29 14:22] <02charlie> no, do you want to be? ;-D
[08/29 14:22] <02charlie> (say no) :D
[08/29 14:22] <dsk_hbe> LOL, so funny Charlie. 
[08/29 14:22] <JimE_zOS> probably not. 
[08/29 14:23] <JimE_zOS> I do hate to not know the things that come at teh team. 
[08/29 14:23] <dsk_hbe> you're a good, no, great, team lead, Jim!!!
[08/29 14:23] <02charlie> i'll send you the latest and you can read at your leisure :D
[08/29 14:25] <JimE_zOS> perfect...thanks. 
[08/29 14:25] <02charlie> sure
[08/29 14:25] <JimE_zOS> so I can give Gordon the smack down when I see him next

[08/29 14:27] <06Amit_zOS> (FG/BG)
[08/29 14:27] <dsk_hbe> on the list?  cool... I haven't had a chance to look yet, but that seems correct
[08/29 14:27] <06Amit_zOS> to=two
[08/29 14:27] <06Amit_zOS> cool beans.. i can have it ready for you to check tomorrow hopefully
[08/29 14:28] <dsk_hbe> ok!!
[08/29 14:28] <02charlie> kate found a place that will do a 9 months lease
[08/29 14:28] <dsk_hbe> you are saving me, Amit... I only have tomorrow left before PTO and I am so behind!
[08/29 14:29] <dsk_hbe> Wow, Charlie... that is kind of her to do... good Grandma
[08/29 14:29] <02charlie> ok, fudgebucket, i need to do my pto paperwork
[08/29 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> Sure.. let us know if we can help with anything else!
[08/29 14:29] <dsk_hbe> (I still win, Charlie ;-)
[08/29 14:29] <02charlie> we offered back in dec-jan
[08/29 14:29] <02charlie> lol
[08/29 14:29] <JimE_zOS> I don't know why Gordon has to mess into things that are working perfectly. 
[08/29 14:30] <dsk_hbe> what happened with the other people?  geez... poor kid must have been frantic
[08/29 14:30] <06Amit_zOS> oh, just a reminder, i will be home putting on some weight in India
[08/29 14:30] <JimE_zOS> or, to say it a different way, his lack of understanding isn't a problem. 
[08/29 14:30] <06Amit_zOS> during most of Jan
[08/29 14:30] <02charlie> i dont think anyone has told her yet
[08/29 14:30] <02charlie> three weeding, id say youd better put on weight, or we'll hurt you when you get back ;)
[08/29 14:30] <dsk_hbe> Gordon messes into everything... I'm gonna be negative again... but you shoudl hear him talk at the PT on Monday's as if allt eh work you are doing he is right on top of... I just cringed glad you weren't ont he call
[08/29 14:47] <JimE_zOS> nobody seems to care about the renames tonight.  Haven't heard a word of protest. 
[08/29 14:48] <02charlie> lol
[08/29 14:48] <02charlie> speak of the devil :)
[08/29 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> haha
[08/29 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> co-incidence?
[08/29 14:49] <02charlie> no such thing :)
[08/29 14:49] <02charlie> raining here now
[08/29 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> Clouds just about to burst here
[08/29 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> no ones protesting Jim!
[08/29 14:51] <02charlie> wife wants to go to a nice dinner tonight, i cant image why ::rolls eyes:: :D

[08/29 15:15] <JimE_zOS> oh, I feel so much better.  Deleted a bunch of internal cluster IDs.  Nothing like it to improve ones mood. 
[08/29 15:16] <02charlie> rotfl
[08/29 15:17] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[08/29 15:19] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/29 15:19] <06Amit_ZOS> who were they?
[08/29 15:25] <JimE_zOS> people who had never used their accounts. 
[08/29 15:25] <JimE_zOS> not even once. 
[08/29 15:25] <JimE_zOS> policy allows we to delete accounts which haven't been used in a year. 
[08/29 15:26] <JimE_zOS> right now, I'm just targetting accounts that have never been used (and are more than a year old) 
[08/29 15:27] <JimE_zOS> external auditors like it when you actively maintain your accounts. 
[08/29 15:27] <JimE_zOS> which, prior to me, we didn't really do very well. 
[08/29 15:29] <JimE_zOS> I've deleted thousands of accounts since I started RACF admin. 
[08/29 15:29] <JimE_zOS> now have automated processes that nuke accounts daily 
[08/29 15:30] <JimE_zOS> but there are some accounts that have residual crud 
[08/29 15:30] <JimE_zOS> have to clean-up the crud before you can remove the account.

[08/29 15:36] <06Amit_ZOS> much like debbie deletes eclipse id's!
[08/29 15:36] <triveni> its drizzling..
[08/29 15:36] <dsk_hbe> it's strangely satisfying ;-)
[08/29 15:36] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/29 15:37] <06Amit_ZOS> i think i will switch connections now
[08/29 15:37] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[08/29 15:37] <06Amit_ZOS> (btw, shortest training ever from anita)
[08/29 15:37] <dsk_hbe> still valuable, no doubt!
[08/29 15:38] <triveni> oh yes
[08/29 15:38] <triveni> v valuable
[08/29 15:38] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh offcourse.. it was on Triveni's request actually
[08/29 15:38] <triveni> i request a lot everywhere.. she took me seriously..
[08/29 15:38] <triveni> feeling glad about that ;)
[08/29 15:39] <06Amit_ZOS> i blame Triveni for the short training.. she didn't ask any questions!
[08/29 15:39] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[08/29 15:39] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[08/29 15:39] <triveni> hahaha
[08/29 15:39] <dsk_hbe> I find that hard to believe ;-)
[08/29 15:39] <triveni> debbie's comment hit me today, 'painfully curious'
[08/29 15:39] <triveni> so i did ask some questions
[08/29 15:39] <02charlie> lol
[08/29 15:39] <triveni> but yeah tried not to be a pain
[08/29 15:39] <06Amit_ZOS> Its true.. it finally happened.. i got to witness it!
[08/29 15:39] <triveni> ;)

[08/29 15:57] <06Amit_ZOS> lol!
[08/29 15:57] <06Amit_ZOS> i was just hoping i didnt miss out on the comments when Jim gets around to reading it!
[08/29 16:06] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I knew that Sharon and Co had taken over zLinux support.   But it is a weird mix.  Sharon knows nothing of the mainframe and zLinux is wrapped around the mainframe in a big way. 
[08/29 16:07] <JimE_zOS> so while Sharon has to roll out ClefOS maint, she has to use the HMC to do so. 
[08/29 16:07] <JimE_zOS> so it is a very, very weird set-up 
[08/29 16:07] <JimE_zOS> and, truth be told, MSP keeps getting called back in to deal with the non-unix things in that setup
[08/29 16:07] <02charlie> hmm, is there something wrong with either //UENFILE  DD DSN=PT00.OPCA.PSQA.JCLLIB(U#PSQA1),DISP=SHR   or with my access to it?
[08/29 16:07] <JimE_zOS> just like Jeff has to deal with teh storage needs.

[08/29 16:08] <02charlie> it was earlier today
[08/29 16:10] <JimE_zOS> what error do you get? 
[08/29 16:10] <02charlie> compare ULESSEV  J104065 (which worked) with ULESSEV  J011035 (which didnt, 2017.08.29 16.03.33.298 UNV0135E Encrypted command file error: error reading file dd:UENFILE: 66, EDC5066I A read system error was detected.)
[08/29 16:11] <JimE_zOS> hmmmmm

[08/29 16:11] <JimE_zOS> TSO OPCLLAR and resubmit

[08/29 16:16] <dsk_hbe> Jeff said that Randy said that Tom was messing with some switch upgrade work and suspects that is what caused my lcre issues so, never questioning Randy, I asked Jeff to go ahead and resolve the ticket

[08/29 16:19] <JimE_zOS>  ditto. 
[08/29 16:19] <JimE_zOS> unix side issue, perhaps. 
[08/29 16:19] <JimE_zOS> is the box OK?

[08/30 11:01] <triveni> brb
[08/30 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, I have made the changes to the jobs that I thought were the obvious changes.. could you check if I have missed out on something?
[08/30 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> the PDS is :UNENMAX.FGBGCHG.JCLLIB
[08/30 11:07] <dsk_hbe> will do!
[08/30 11:08] <06Amit_ZOS> also.. there are only 3 jobs there, 2 of your daily jobs(e88dsk50,60) and ERJCSOR
[08/30 11:09] <06Amit_ZOS> not sure if there are any more.?
[08/30 11:09] <dsk_hbe> ok, yeah, nothing else is coming to me yet... we may just have to deal with any others as we hit them
[08/30 11:09] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[08/30 11:14] <triveni> b
[08/30 11:17] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, I'm checking my jobs before I finish lookign at your changes.  Looks like there is a little step in e88dsk40 that loosk for BG copies too.  Can you add that guy to your changes?
[08/30 11:18] <06Amit_ZOS> will do
[08/30 11:18] <dsk_hbe> thanks!
[08/30 11:21] <triveni> amit tell me.. when u r done..i ll look at it just to know..
[08/30 11:22] <triveni> debbie.. when are we planning for twf changes in prod.. i would like to do that..
[08/30 11:22] <06Amit_ZOS> done with e88dsk40 too
[08/30 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> i think
[08/30 11:23] <dsk_hbe> we haven't gotten a work request on it yet, Triveni.  I think Vickie is still evaluating tests that are run through C1
[08/30 11:23] <dsk_hbe> kthx, mit!
[08/30 11:23] <dsk_hbe> ahem, Amit!
[08/30 11:23] <triveni> ok..
[08/30 11:29] <triveni> debbie..i saw the incident mail for the lcre box issue..ur description in the incident is helpful..
[08/30 11:29] <triveni> i was trying to understand how u figured out what started the issue..
[08/30 11:29] <dsk_hbe> cool!  I learned a lot myself just trying to figure that one out
[08/30 11:30] <triveni> the incident details is having that.. so m able to understand.
[08/30 11:30] <dsk_hbe> great!  I'll also forward you the conversation I had in email with Durkin and Cassidy if you are interested?
[08/30 11:32] <triveni> yes
[08/30 11:32] <triveni> that will be great
[08/30 11:32] <dsk_hbe> ok, give me a couple minutes and I'll gather those up
[08/30 11:32] <triveni> thank you!
[08/30 11:34] <dsk_hbe> your changes all look good to me, Amit.  Thank you so much!!
[08/30 11:41] <triveni> so now the changes done by amit.. will be implemented for daily run for e88dsk* jobs.
[08/30 11:41] <triveni> or its just a one time run
[08/30 11:43] <dsk_hbe> they go along with Jim's shift of the BG/FG copies.  Once that shift is in place and our new config, the changes Amit has made will need to be the new daily runs for those jobs to accomodate the new BG/FG config
[08/30 11:43] <triveni> ok
[08/30 11:44] <dsk_hbe> so whent he time is right, he'll move those jobs in place of the current jobs in the pt00.opca.olmr.jcllib 
[08/30 11:44] <dsk_hbe> oh man, poor Bobbie
[08/30 11:44] <triveni> ok
[08/30 11:45] <triveni> i ll do the cancellation

[08/30 12:03] <dsk_hbe> I don't knwo enough about what they are talking baout to know.  Better ask when Jim is around
[08/30 12:03] <dsk_hbe> he said they renamed last night though so I'd bet it is
[08/30 12:04] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah.. i was there untill 11 or so.. and he said: "based on the fact that ICS has SDS related stuff in the error list, I don't they were told about properties file name changes either. "
[08/30 12:06] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. anyway.. will talk to Jim about it later
[08/30 12:07] <dsk_hbe> yeah, who knows where ICS stands (by that he means Release Deployment... ICS was their old name). 
[08/30 12:07] <dsk_hbe> we may not hear much about their stuff sicne it's cert
[08/30 12:07] <06Amit_ZOS> Ah

[08/30 13:14] <triveni> debbie.. m just reading the mail u sent
[08/30 13:15] <triveni> my brain is populating with lot of questions.
[08/30 13:16] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[08/30 13:16] <triveni> i wanted to know.. when u started looking at the issue.. u looked at the logs in unix side.. which must have showed the chasm bouncing msgs..
[08/30 13:16] <triveni> m i right..
[08/30 13:17] <dsk_hbe> yes... I started looking at the chasmmonitor logs but when that got a little tiresome, I actually ran a smapi report of chasm errors where I coudl more easily see the order of all of the bouncing.  I shodul have shared that too since it got lost in all the replies in the email chain.  I'll send that to you now.
[08/30 13:17] <triveni> ok
[08/30 13:18] <dsk_hbe> there ya go
[08/30 13:19] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/30 13:20] <dsk_hbe> oh and oops, I shodul have shared this with you to be able to understand the states in that smapi report - https://lngit.lexisnexis.com/sites/sys-sup/How%20Tos%20Limited%20Access/Chasm%20Control%20States%20values.aspx
[08/30 13:21] <dsk_hbe> that is on the ss sharepoint and lists what all the different chasm values mean, i.e. '2' = down
[08/30 13:21] <triveni> ok
[08/30 13:22] <triveni> so running smapi for all type of messages.. also showed u that cre copies got started for second time
[08/30 13:23] <dsk_hbe> well, it told me that psc1877 thought our copies were down and therefore that let chasmexec think he needed to restart them.
[08/30 13:23] <triveni> ok
[08/30 13:23] <02charlie> oh, would you mind sharing that wil me also, debbie?
[08/30 13:24] <dsk_hbe> worked fine for the chasm apps and ID_dime, but our start script manages to cause two LCRE copies to be up.
[08/30 13:24] <dsk_hbe> oh sure, sorry, Charlie!  sec!
[08/30 13:25] <02charlie> thx
[08/30 13:30] <dsk_hbe> 1on1 time for me
[08/30 13:48] <02charlie> thx deb, evry informative
[08/30 13:48] <02charlie> stepping away to direct movers
[08/30 13:52] <06Amit_zOS> GK10XM        006143030--- Debbie, did you catch this guy today?
[08/30 13:53] <02charlie> b
[08/30 13:53] <triveni> thanks debbie.. i went through all those attachments.. the world is making sense to me now..And my brain feels a little lightheaded..
[08/30 13:53] <triveni> ;)
[08/30 14:07] <dsk_hbe> back
[08/30 14:08] <dsk_hbe> Good eye Amit, yeh I put him in my notepad to look at but haven't yet.  It's Cision... a user who has been trouble for us int eh past, but not so much lately
[08/30 14:09] <02charlie> meant to ask you a question, debbie, but it has escaped my mind
[08/30 14:09] <dsk_hbe> glad you feel enlightened, Triveni ;-)
[08/30 14:09] <dsk_hbe> let me know if it comes back to you Charlie :-)
[08/30 14:09] <02charlie> probably at 2 am :)
[08/30 14:09] <triveni> ;)
[08/30 14:09] <dsk_hbe> don't call me then ;-)
[08/30 14:10] <02charlie> oh, yeah, did you ever find out from JimC how the chasm ring display is generated?
[08/30 14:11] <dsk_hbe> oh he didn't answer that part so no.  He's too busy catching up with everyone so I thought I'd let it ride for now.  Help me remember to ask him again if his life ever calms down!
[08/30 14:12] <triveni> hahaha
[08/30 14:16] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[08/30 14:20] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, though, Charlie, what I do know is you can look at the chasm parms for chasmmonitor and it will tell you which ring it is in.  i.e. on psc1875 in /l-n/snapshotsI find this:
[08/30 14:20] <dsk_hbe> [kamburds@psc1875 snapshots]$ egrep -i ring *
[08/30 14:20] <dsk_hbe> psc1875.ChasmMonitor_prod_001.sh:smacMonRing="MIA.SS.zLinux"
[08/30 14:20] <dsk_hbe> psc1875.ChasmMonitor_prod_001.sh:export smacMonRing
[08/30 14:20] <02charlie> ah thx
[08/30 14:20] <dsk_hbe> and when I checked the same for other zlinux boxes I found they all used that same ring
[08/30 14:21] <dsk_hbe> what I really wanted is what you asked about though... cause I wasn't sure if it might reach outside of just our zlinux boxes... kinda felt that'd be a bad thing to find
[08/30 14:23] <02charlie> love the name of the ring: MIA.SS.zLinux
[08/30 14:24] <dsk_hbe> yeah, mia ;-)  missing in action... kinda appropriate
[08/30 14:24] <02charlie> yeah
[08/30 14:27] <triveni> i want to run this /l-n/snapshotsI
[08/30 14:27] <triveni> command not found 
[08/30 14:27] <triveni> i was trying to find it in ur alias file or .cshrc
[08/30 14:27] <triveni> how will i be able to run it.. i didn't find it there..
[08/30 14:27] <dsk_hbe> take the 'I' off the end... I typo'd.  and it's not a script, it's a directory
[08/30 14:28] <triveni> ohh
[08/30 14:29] <dsk_hbe> it holds a very handy set of files.  The bottom half, the pnes that start with psc1875, for example on that box, are supposed to hold all of the chasm overrides that we might see set up when we use chasmtui to look at their parms... so handy to not have to go to chasmtui all the time
[08/30 14:29] <triveni> thanks debbie
[08/30 14:31] <02charlie> here's what I have in my notes: /snapshots -> /l-n/snapshots (/l-n/ols/prod/snapshots in USS): snapshot file which shows the startup parms for the various applications; especially useful when Chasm has issues with status (see next entry) (i believe all this info came from debbie
[08/30 14:31] <triveni> i ll save it 
[08/30 14:31] <dsk_hbe> yep!
[08/30 14:31] <02charlie> it's in the cheat sheet
[08/30 14:31] <02charlie> :)
[08/30 14:31] <dsk_hbe> well, I got it from JimC to be fair ;-)
[08/30 14:32] <dsk_hbe> and why does USS have to be such a pain and be so different all the time??? ;-)
[08/30 14:37] <02charlie> do you know how jim generated this?

[08/30 14:37] <dsk_hbe> that's the thing he didn't answer... was that not what you were asking me before?
[08/30 14:38] <02charlie> oh, ok
[08/30 14:39] <dsk_hbe> ok, thought maybe I answered the wrong question before :-)

[08/30 22:12] <JimE_zOS> in your inbox, Amit. 
[08/30 22:12] <JimE_zOS> subtle change. 
[08/30 22:12] <JimE_zOS> so we don't include eclipse searching in our usage data. 
[08/30 22:14] <06Amit_zOS> Cool..

[08/31 11:31] <triveni> thanks debbie..
[08/31 11:31] <triveni> everything seems good so far..
[08/31 11:51] <06Amit_zOS> what about the Negative news issue Debbie?
[08/31 11:52] <dsk_away> was that from Hankins' note?
[08/31 11:52] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[08/31 11:52] <dsk_away> sec
[08/31 11:52] <06Amit_zOS> the Arachnys
[08/31 11:54] <06Amit_zOS> i tried searching for qbrws errors for today untill 10 am.. nothing came up under the 
[08/31 11:54] <06Amit_zOS> ARACHNYS
[08/31 11:55] <dsk_away> ditto for Dianne's TOMMEHAN... looking further to find where she is erroring
[08/31 11:55] <06Amit_zOS> just looking for KER's with that id now
[08/31 11:56] <triveni> are you looking through smapi
[08/31 11:56] <dsk_away> good idea cause webspec can't find it
[08/31 11:56] <dsk_away> yep
[08/31 11:56] <triveni> ok
[08/31 11:56] <06Amit_zOS> not sure if that was a webid or lexisid.. i am trying both
[08/31 11:56] <06Amit_zOS> webid i got some hits
[08/31 11:56] <dsk_away> I see errors int he wspai apps for arachnys... pulling one of  those up.
[08/31 11:57] <dsk_away> those two we both pasted are webids
[08/31 11:58] <dsk_away> did you find kers for TOMMEHAN, Amit?
[08/31 11:59] <06Amit_zOS> found kets for arachnys
[08/31 12:00] <dsk_away> yes, but not tommehan?
[08/31 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> doing for tommehan not..
[08/31 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> now*
[08/31 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> it has some hits
[08/31 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> still loading
[08/31 12:00] <dsk_away> where?
[08/31 12:00] <dsk_away> in qsrch?
[08/31 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> (im assuming there are hits cz its taking too much time
[08/31 12:01] <dsk_away> likely
[08/31 12:01] <dsk_away> were you searching in qsrch?
[08/31 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> yesh i have given qbrws,qsearch and qcite
[08/31 12:01] <dsk_away> ok, cool
[08/31 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> well actually i got nothing after that!
[08/31 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/31 12:02] <06Amit_zOS> no hits
[08/31 12:02] <dsk_away> ok, emailing to get clarification on that and so they know we are looking.
[08/31 12:03] <dsk_away> I guess it just took so long since you gave it 3 apps to look at... that'll happen... especially on same day quierioes
[08/31 12:03] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[08/31 12:04] <06Amit_zOS> how do u filter by the apps? i saw s.selector as wsapi for arachnys
[08/31 12:04] <06Amit_zOS> but couldnt figure how i can filter using that
[08/31 12:05] <dsk_away> you do to the smapi tab and locate wsapi there to search on
[08/31 12:05] <06Amit_zOS> oh do the *wsapi* on the vchinfo!?
[08/31 12:06] <dsk_away> no, under the smapi browser tab, locate wsapi in the applications
[08/31 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[08/31 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[08/31 12:07] <dsk_away> I hate tomcat logs but remind me to show you these soon
[08/31 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[08/31 12:12] <06Amit_zOS> no error records for TOMMEENANC for qbrws or wsapi
[08/31 12:14] <dsk_away> saw one for qsrch
[08/31 12:16] <06Amit_zOS> the null point exception
[08/31 12:16] <06Amit_zOS> i grabbed the transuuid from there
[08/31 12:16] <dsk_away> you're doing great!
[08/31 12:17] <06Amit_zOS> is the pqskey of any use?
[08/31 12:17] <dsk_away> always!
[08/31 12:17] <dsk_away> but if she ran this herself, that one may not be the one she failed on... sigh... 
[08/31 12:17] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[08/31 12:18] <dsk_away> I hate when smapi is so dog slow
[08/31 12:18] <06Amit_zOS> i have to login to psc1828 and check the logs don't i?
[08/31 12:18] <06Amit_zOS> :-(
[08/31 12:18] <dsk_away> to get the search?  if you are using secure smapi the search will be there
[08/31 12:19] <dsk_away> hmmm... not sure I see a null pointer in the error I saw
[08/31 12:21] <dsk_away> ignore my pointer comment... we must be looking at different output
[08/31 12:25] <06Amit_zOS> could you ping me the secure smapi url? i dont think i have it bookmarked seperately
[08/31 12:26] <dsk_away> http://lngcentral.lexisnexis.com/webs/rap/secure/reports/SmapiBrowserS.asp
[08/31 12:26] <06Amit_zOS> Thank you
[08/31 12:38] <dsk_away> I think the dimestore is being flakey :-(
[08/31 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> for DIVYAAMAR, i see a document not available error
[08/31 12:45] <06Amit_zOS> well its not an error for smapi though cz its under KER
[08/31 12:47] <06Amit_zOS> that was what your mail was talking about i see
[08/31 12:47] <dsk_away> yeah, finishing up our gathered stats now and including that... she wasn't on the cc
[08/31 12:49] <06Amit_zOS> My God Debbie! you'r lightning fast!
[08/31 12:49] <dsk_away> hahaha... I was feelign realy slow actually ;-)
[08/31 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> |_o_|
[08/31 12:57] <dsk_away> check me Amit... see if you see any qsrch or qbrws errors for SARAHFAHYF
[08/31 12:58] <06Amit_zOS> the menu build failed because the menu server was down again is it?
[08/31 12:58] <triveni> the ticket came for that
[08/31 12:59] <06Amit_zOS> no errors untill 10 am
[08/31 12:59] <dsk_away> until?  I saw none at all... what do you see?
[08/31 12:59] <dsk_away> or do you mean you only checked to 10am?
[08/31 13:00] <06Amit_zOS> i had checked untill 10 am
[08/31 13:00] <dsk_away> ah ok, good, thx!
[08/31 13:01] <06Amit_zOS> even after that no errors
[08/31 13:01] <dsk_away> cool
[08/31 13:04] <triveni> same here.. i didnt find errors for sarahfahyf while i got error records fro divyaamar
[08/31 13:04] <dsk_away> cool
[08/31 13:05] <06Amit_zOS> she had 357 searches and all of them shouw as request successfull and docs found is 1
[08/31 13:08] <triveni> debbie.. for the ticket which came in.. last time it was fixed..when missing datasets were reallocated.
[08/31 13:08] <06Amit_zOS> 3 wsapi errors : 2 invalid faults and 1 internal system error
[08/31 13:12] <dsk_away> sec, lemme finish this email
[08/31 13:14] <dsk_away> did someone say we cancelled renames again today?
[08/31 13:15] <triveni> we cancelled renames yesterday for 08/31
[08/31 13:15] <triveni> that we did
[08/31 13:15] <dsk_away> I may be dreaming... either way... let's wait for Jim on that one.  I don't want to assume I'd know what all needs done on it.  If you start to get pressured on the ticket, I'm sure Jim would appreciate a page
[08/31 13:15] <triveni> the ticket wasn't paged
[08/31 13:16] <dsk_away> that's because Rajesh in metadata tools just moved it into our queue instead of sending it back through OPS
[08/31 13:17] <triveni> ohh
[08/31 13:17] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:17] <dsk_away> I guess in my opinion maybe it's best for you to page Jim now... else we will be to blame for them having to cancel renames again
[08/31 13:17] <triveni> STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU NOT FOUND
[08/31 13:17] <dsk_away> and I really need to stop being here ;-)
[08/31 13:17] <triveni> this is what's happening
[08/31 13:18] <triveni> it must have been archived
[08/31 13:18] <06Amit_zOS> yes you do!
[08/31 13:18] <triveni> and we have to restore it
[08/31 13:18] <triveni> ok i ll page Jim..
[08/31 13:18] <triveni> and wait for his wrath..
[08/31 13:18] <dsk_away> I do know how to issue a restore if you want me to show you, but I don't want to usurp Jim's opinion on here
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away> yep it was archived yesterday:
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away> ARCHIVE INFORMATION:
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away>    Archive date:              30AUG2017
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away>    Archive Time:              18:54
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away> It's simple to restore if it comes to that.  TSO option D.A is where you'd do it.
[08/31 13:20] <dsk_away> oops... A.D
[08/31 13:21] <dsk_away> and so you know, the restores run at the top of each hour
[08/31 13:21] <dsk_away> once you schedule them
[08/31 13:21] <dsk_away> ok, I need to go away now, but page if you need me!
[08/31 13:22] <triveni> ok debbie
[08/31 13:22] <triveni> thanks
[08/31 13:22] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks a lot Debbie! :)
[08/31 13:22] <06Amit_zOS> we
[08/31 13:22] <06Amit_zOS> we'd be lost without u!
[08/31 13:22] <dsk_away> ha!!
[08/31 13:23] <triveni> yeah so true!!
[08/31 13:23] <triveni> thank you!
[08/31 13:24] <06Amit_zOS> i would have bugged the daylights out of the devs here!
[08/31 13:24] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[08/31 13:33] <06Amit_zOS> btw, SE00WTOOLKITCLN is in error since yesterday night.. could that be one of the issues with these wsapi issues?
[08/31 13:38] <dsk_away> I have no clue on that Amit... maybe???  I suspect instead we are counting searches wrong on that threshhodl thing!
[08/31 13:38] <dsk_away> ok, now away again... forgot to hit send on that one note.
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[08/31 13:39] <dsk_away> hi :-)  Bye :-) 
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> not that I'm not happy to see you, Debbie, but shouldn't you be gone? 
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> jinx! 
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> bye! 
[08/31 13:39] <dsk_away> I am soooooo gone now ;-)
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> me too. 
[08/31 13:39] <JimE_zOS> almost to Vegas when I got the page :-)
[08/31 13:39] <dsk_away> :-)
[08/31 13:39] <triveni> sorry to wake u up Jim..
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> you didn't.
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> so not to worry 
[08/31 13:40] <triveni> :)
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> hot shower and coffee is almost as good as sleep. 
[08/31 13:40] <dsk_away> I didn't want to assume I knew enough to help them on the ticket... maybe a simple restore... but I preferred they ask you first
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> almost. 
[08/31 13:40] <dsk_away> now gone :-)
[08/31 13:40] <triveni> bye debbie!
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> enjoy your holiday and family time, Debbie. 
[08/31 13:40] <JimE_zOS> k...."T"....talk to me. 
[08/31 13:41] <triveni> yup
[08/31 13:41] <JimE_zOS> (and thanks for teh metadata cancellation yesterday, BTW) 
[08/31 13:41] <triveni> did that create more problems
[08/31 13:41] <triveni> :(
[08/31 13:41] <JimE_zOS> nope....it was fine. 
[08/31 13:41] <JimE_zOS> thanks for taking care of that for me.  I appreciate the help. 
[08/31 13:41] <triveni> ok 
[08/31 13:42] <triveni> happy to help :)
[08/31 13:42] <JimE_zOS> so what has you bothered now? 
[08/31 13:42] <triveni> so we have 
[08/31 13:42] <triveni> a ticket
[08/31 13:42] <triveni> I6CMNUBR job is in error
[08/31 13:42] <JimE_zOS> is it a golden ticket? (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory reference) 
[08/31 13:42] <triveni> STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU NOT FOUND
[08/31 13:43] <JimE_zOS> k....thinking 
[08/31 13:43] <triveni> and i saw it in the reference.. this type of tickets were solved by restoring the missing dataset.
[08/31 13:43] <triveni> but we wanted to be sure.. on the next step
[08/31 13:44] <triveni> and if you could tell me..where can i see that job.. i tried in a.s.s and spools.. but not sure.. where it is..
[08/31 13:44] <triveni> m looking at in opc then
[08/31 13:44] <triveni> for this application, SI6CMENUBLDRELS
[08/31 13:44] <JimE_zOS> I doubt restore will help us. 
[08/31 13:44] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> let's come back to that 
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> first, I see: 
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> 17/08/31 02.54 SI6CMENUBLDRELS  CPU1   5 I6CMNUBR JCL  
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> 17/08/31 12.57 SI6CMENUBLDROSET CPU1  20 I6CROS04 0168 
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> in the error list. 
[08/31 13:45] <JimE_zOS> other things too, of course, but these apps are from the same family 
[08/31 13:45] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:46] <JimE_zOS> the ticket is for the release menu dataset so that is the SI6CMENUBLDRELS application
[08/31 13:46] <JimE_zOS> curious to know why the other app is in error too. 
[08/31 13:46] <triveni> yes
[08/31 13:46] <JimE_zOS> let's track down a job and see what can find. 
[08/31 13:46] <triveni> yeah
[08/31 13:47] <triveni> where will it be
[08/31 13:47] <triveni> which system i should look for
[08/31 13:47] <triveni> one of the job route said DCC
[08/31 13:47] <triveni> but it was not in sysc
[08/31 13:47] <triveni> maybe i missed something
[08/31 13:47] <JimE_zOS> it is, actually, on SYSC. 
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> I agree w/you...not on spool
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> and not in A.S.S 
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> =a.s
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> but keep in mind that we put most of our jobs in A.S.S 
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> i found I6CROS04
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> this
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> but there is another SAVRS DB 
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> A.S 
[08/31 13:48] <JimE_zOS> try there for I6CMNUBR
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> both
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> yrd
[08/31 13:48] <triveni> yes
[08/31 13:49] <JimE_zOS>    SEL# ACT  JOBNAME    JOB # C ACK    CCODE       START DATE      TIME 
[08/31 13:49] <JimE_zOS> _     1      I6CMNUBR 0108448 R        JCL ERR THU 31 AUG 2017.243 02:54
[08/31 13:49] <06Amit_zOS> it just says the dsn is not found
[08/31 13:50] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I see that. 
[08/31 13:50] <triveni> the other job is failing at universal command step
[08/31 13:50] <JimE_zOS> so the dataset has to be pre-allocated
[08/31 13:50] <JimE_zOS> ie, it isn't allocated by the job itself. 
[08/31 13:50] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:51] <JimE_zOS> we'll come back to the other job. 
[08/31 13:51] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:51] <JimE_zOS> I just wanted to point out that metadata family isn't feeling well. 
[08/31 13:51] <triveni> yeah
[08/31 13:51] <JimE_zOS> and the DSN starts with STAGED 
[08/31 13:51] <JimE_zOS> so the contents go to mega-staging. 
[08/31 13:52] <JimE_zOS> and, specifically and "M" volume. 
[08/31 13:52] <JimE_zOS> (VOLSER starting with "M". 
[08/31 13:52] <JimE_zOS> which, BTW, Lexis can't read. 
[08/31 13:52] <JimE_zOS> so whatever we build there, it must be a temporary home for the content. 
[08/31 13:52] <triveni> ohh
[08/31 13:54] <triveni> jim this job creates the dsn STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU
[08/31 13:55] <JimE_zOS> I don't think it creates the dataset, Triveni, I think it overwrites whatever is there. 
[08/31 13:55] <JimE_zOS> ie, the dataset has to be pre-allocated for the job to run 
[08/31 13:55] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:55] <JimE_zOS> I find this in DMS 
[08/31 13:55] <JimE_zOS>   Archived                                        - Archived -

[08/31 13:55] <triveni> so v have to restore it
[08/31 13:55] <JimE_zOS> I don't think you do, exactly 
[08/31 13:56] <triveni> its archived
[08/31 13:56] <JimE_zOS> since the job that failed is going to build completely new menu content, restoring seems like a waste to me. 
[08/31 13:56] <triveni> ohh
[08/31 13:56] <JimE_zOS> so I think a simple allocation (as in pre-allocated) is good enough. 
[08/31 13:57] <JimE_zOS> I think restoring would work too, but that seems like a lot of effort to just have the contents completely re-created 
[08/31 13:57] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:58] <triveni> so how are we allocating it
[08/31 13:58] <JimE_zOS> good question. 
[08/31 13:58] <JimE_zOS> the DCB attributes will be important, so let's take a look at the other FABC menu datasets for clues 
[08/31 13:59] <triveni> ok
[08/31 13:59] <triveni> its written in the jcl
[08/31 14:00] <triveni> DCB=(LRECL=11476,BLKSIZE=11476),
[08/31 14:00] <JimE_zOS> k...we'll need that.  
[08/31 14:01] <JimE_zOS> and the space will be important too. 
[08/31 14:01] <JimE_zOS> oh, got an idea....sec 
[08/31 14:02] <triveni> can't i see the info of the archived datasets 
[08/31 14:03] <JimE_zOS> yeah...DMS doesn't show that 
[08/31 14:03] <JimE_zOS> at least I don't know how to find that in DMS. 
[08/31 14:03] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:03] <JimE_zOS> and to be honest, most apps aren't as funny about datasets as LEXIS is. 
[08/31 14:03] <JimE_zOS> so we have to be uber (app joke) careful 
[08/31 14:04] <JimE_zOS> actually took my first Uber ride in Paris 
[08/31 14:04] <triveni> haha
[08/31 14:04] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:05] <JimE_zOS> remember that I said that data on "M" volumes couldn't be read by the OLS? 
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> Allocation type:           TRK
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> Allocation quantity:       1500
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> i got it
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> in dms
[08/31 14:05] <JimE_zOS> and that whatever we build there is just a temporary copy? 
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> DASD volser:               MM000K
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> Device type:               3390
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> Organization:              PS
[08/31 14:05] <JimE_zOS> I think you can forget DMS 
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU
[08/31 14:05] <JimE_zOS> follow along so you don't miss the point, please. 
[08/31 14:05] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:06] <JimE_zOS> right....temporary copy...can't be used by the OLS. 
[08/31 14:06] <triveni> i will be here with you now
[08/31 14:06] <triveni> oh yeah
[08/31 14:06] <JimE_zOS> which means that we must copy these STAGED datasets to an "L" volume at some point in the flow
[08/31 14:06] <triveni> but we got space now
[08/31 14:06] <JimE_zOS> and "L" volumes are never processed by Storage Mgt routines 
[08/31 14:07] <triveni> ohh
[08/31 14:07] <triveni> got it
[08/31 14:07] <JimE_zOS> ie, nothing is archived
[08/31 14:07] <triveni> yup
[08/31 14:07] <triveni> so v have to find out the L volume dataset
[08/31 14:07] <JimE_zOS> so, that means that if we can find the true OLS dataset, we'll know how to reverse engineer these "M" datasets, right? 
[08/31 14:07] <triveni> yup
[08/31 14:07] <JimE_zOS> jinx (you said the same thing...but first) 
[08/31 14:08] <JimE_zOS> I think U R looking for these: 
[08/31 14:08] <JimE_zOS> NL00.FABC1.PROD.CL00.METADATA.RLSE.MNU                         LT09M5

[08/31 14:08] <triveni> tadaa....m giving the music..
[08/31 14:08] <triveni> u found it
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> so v need Volume serial . . . : LT09M1
[08/31 14:09] <JimE_zOS> we don't need the VOLSER, we need the attributes of those datasets 
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> sorry not the prep one.. LT09M5 (prod)
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> ok 
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> 1st extent tracks . : 1500
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> Secondary tracks  . : 0
[08/31 14:09] <triveni> cool
[08/31 14:10] <triveni> so v have all the attributes now.. including space
[08/31 14:10] <JimE_zOS> we need to allocate (or copy would be the easy way) those datasets 
[08/31 14:10] <06Amit_zOS> so copying through tso or jcl? i know you like jcl better
[08/31 14:10] <JimE_zOS> yes, we do.
[08/31 14:10] <triveni> perfect
[08/31 14:10] <JimE_zOS> could still do just an allocation. 
[08/31 14:10] <JimE_zOS> but copy is pretty easy 
[08/31 14:10] <triveni> m trying to open it
[08/31 14:10] <JimE_zOS> so....let me find you some JCL...sec
[08/31 14:11] <triveni> less records
[08/31 14:11] <triveni> v can do a simple tso copy too
[08/31 14:11] <JimE_zOS> I suspect that the datasets are too big. 
[08/31 14:11] <JimE_zOS>  NL00.FABC1.PROD.CL00.METADATA.RLSE.MNU               1500

[08/31 14:11] <triveni> 001867
[08/31 14:11] <triveni> records
[08/31 14:12] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:12] <JimE_zOS> I'd rather use SYNCSORT. 
[08/31 14:12] <triveni> so idcams
[08/31 14:12] <JimE_zOS> hang on. 
[08/31 14:12] <JimE_zOS> looking for JCL. 
[08/31 14:12] <triveni> ok 
[08/31 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> syncsort syncsor syncsort
[08/31 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> i guess im just hungry
[08/31 14:13] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[08/31 14:13] * Amit_zOS is now known as Amit_away
[08/31 14:14] <triveni> i found something in ur jcllib
[08/31 14:14] <triveni> UEVANJR.ISPF.JCLLIB(LSDEXTR)
[08/31 14:14] <JimE_zOS> let go of my dataset, please. 
[08/31 14:15] <triveni> syncsort step
[08/31 14:15] <JimE_zOS> not what I want you to use. 
[08/31 14:15] <triveni> m just viewing
[08/31 14:15] <JimE_zOS> but you preventing me from putting the JCL I want in the dataset because I need exclusive access. 
[08/31 14:15] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:15] <JimE_zOS> which I can't have because you have the dataset. 
[08/31 14:15] <triveni> see its all urs now
[08/31 14:18] <JimE_zOS> k...grab the "T" member in my JCLLIB, please. 
[08/31 14:19] <JimE_zOS> that uses a tool I wrote called A$LIKE (allocate like) 
[08/31 14:19] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> you give it the name of a source dataset, it'll look up the attributes for you and create a new dataset (target) with matching attributes. 
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> there are 4 lines that matter: 
[08/31 14:20] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:20] <triveni> yeah it asked me paramerters
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> SET SOURCE=STAGE1.PS00.SYSI.FLATFILE   
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> SET TARGET=PZ01.SYSI.FLATFILE.D160615  
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> SET OVERRIDE='VOLSER=LT090A'           
[08/31 14:20] <JimE_zOS> SET OVERRIDE='ESO=PSTOR'               
[08/31 14:21] <JimE_zOS> source dataset would be one of the NL00 datasets we pasted above. 
[08/31 14:21] <JimE_zOS> target would be one of the missing dataset names. 
[08/31 14:21] <JimE_zOS> ignore the VOLSER= line 
[08/31 14:21] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:22] <JimE_zOS> and change the SECOND override line to 'ESO=STAGED'
[08/31 14:23] <triveni> // SET SOURCE=NL00.FABC1.PROD.CL00.METADATA.RLSE.MNU
[08/31 14:23] <triveni> // SET TARGET=STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU
[08/31 14:23] <triveni> //*
[08/31 14:23] <triveni> // SET OVERRIDE='VOLSER=LT090A'
[08/31 14:23] <triveni> // SET OVERRIDE='ESO=STAGED'
[08/31 14:24] <triveni> should i run it with my id now
[08/31 14:24] <triveni> or anything else
[08/31 14:25] <JimE_zOS> yep...run away 
[08/31 14:25] <JimE_zOS> you'll need to do that for all four of the missing datasets. 
[08/31 14:25] <triveni> UBANPTXC J024884
[08/31 14:25] <JimE_zOS> and this way you didn't really have to look up attributes or code a bunch of JCL 
[08/31 14:25] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:26] <triveni> yeah
[08/31 14:26] <JimE_zOS> and it uses SYNCSORT so the I/O is blindingly fast. 
[08/31 14:27] <triveni> STAGED.NI00.FABC.PREP.METADATA.RLSE.MNU.LIB
[08/31 14:28] <triveni> fls
[08/31 14:28] <triveni> and def
[08/31 14:28] <triveni> i ll run for them
[08/31 14:28] <JimE_zOS> yes, please.

[08/31 14:32] <triveni> jim
[08/31 14:32] <JimE_zOS> k....very good. 
[08/31 14:32] <triveni> wait
[08/31 14:32] <triveni> no
[08/31 14:32] <JimE_zOS> waiting. 
[08/31 14:32] <triveni> can i delete these staged datasets
[08/31 14:33] <triveni> and again run the job
[08/31 14:33] <triveni> do i have privellege to delete the staged datasets
[08/31 14:33] <JimE_zOS> you had authority to create them, why wouldn't you have the authority to delete them? 
[08/31 14:33] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:33] <JimE_zOS> but why do you need to do that? 
[08/31 14:33] <triveni> i think i copied one def file to lib file
[08/31 14:34] <triveni> so i want to correct it
[08/31 14:34] <triveni> gimme a sec
[08/31 14:34] <JimE_zOS> k
[08/31 14:34] <JimE_zOS> neatness counts

[08/31 14:37] <triveni> i think v r good now
[08/31 14:37] <JimE_zOS> k....looking 
[08/31 14:38] <JimE_zOS> k...fine. 
[08/31 14:38] <JimE_zOS> so what do you suggest next? 
[08/31 14:39] <triveni> so r v going to update the ticket 
[08/31 14:39] <triveni> or do we have to run the job
[08/31 14:39] <triveni> i mean its there application
[08/31 14:39] <JimE_zOS> I'm not worried about the ticket just yet 
[08/31 14:40] <JimE_zOS> I want to know if we have restored service. 
[08/31 14:40] <triveni> job didn't run.. its in failed state.. and so is the application in eror state..
[08/31 14:40] <triveni> v got the old datasets but v need to create new ones. i guess.
[08/31 14:40] <JimE_zOS> you lost me. 
[08/31 14:40] <triveni> m thinking should v run the job
[08/31 14:40] <JimE_zOS> did we try to run the failed job again? 
[08/31 14:40] <triveni> no 
[08/31 14:40] <triveni> not yet
[08/31 14:41] <triveni> v can run it though..
[08/31 14:41] <JimE_zOS> so what do we need to do so that we can do that? 
[08/31 14:41] <triveni> m saying the job won't fail now
[08/31 14:41] <JimE_zOS> let's hope it won't 
[08/31 14:41] <JimE_zOS> but only one way to know for sure. 
[08/31 14:42] <triveni> lets run it
[08/31 14:42] <triveni> should i do it through opc
[08/31 14:42] <JimE_zOS> by all means. 
[08/31 14:42] <JimE_zOS> only way you can do it. 
[08/31 14:43] <triveni> sjr
[08/31 14:43] <JimE_zOS> SJR will work, yes
[08/31 14:43] <triveni> SI6CMENUBLDRELS
[08/31 14:43] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:44] <JimE_zOS> how long did the last job run before it failed? 
[08/31 14:45] <triveni> 1 sec i guess
[08/31 14:45] <triveni> TOTAL CPU TIME=   .00
[08/31 14:46] <JimE_zOS> walltime might be a better gauge in this case. 
[08/31 14:46] <JimE_zOS> but you make the clear point that it didn't run very long. 
[08/31 14:46] <JimE_zOS> so if the jobs starts and doesn't immediately fail, we are probably on the right track.  Agreed? 
[08/31 14:47] <triveni> yes
[08/31 14:47] <triveni> its running
[08/31 14:47] <triveni> I6CMNUBR J044198
[08/31 14:49] <JimE_zOS> k....then I think we could update teh ticket with a note saying the the archived datasets have been recovered and that the job is running. 
[08/31 14:49] <triveni> but what if it fails
[08/31 14:49] <JimE_zOS> assuming it runs to completion, I think we could resolve the ticket. 
[08/31 14:49] <triveni> lets wait
[08/31 14:49] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:49] <triveni> can i update it 
[08/31 14:49] <JimE_zOS> I didn't say resolve it, I said update it. 
[08/31 14:49] <triveni> the ticket
[08/31 14:51] <JimE_zOS> I'll just let you re-read the above as an answer 
[08/31 14:51] <triveni> ok
[08/31 14:53] <triveni> are u updating the ticket Jim..
[08/31 14:53] <triveni> right now..
[08/31 14:53] <JimE_zOS> nope
[08/31 14:53] <triveni> so should i do it
[08/31 14:54] <JimE_zOS> since you did the work, I kinda had in mind you would update the ticket. 
[08/31 14:54] <triveni> ok Jim.
[08/31 14:54] <triveni> thank you.
[08/31 14:54] <JimE_zOS> in fact, first rule around here....if you own the ticket, you are the only person to touch it. 
[08/31 14:54] <JimE_zOS> (or do the work. 
[08/31 14:55] <triveni> ok.. the rules.. i ll remember..
[08/31 14:55] <JimE_zOS> that's how we keep from walking on each other. 
[08/31 14:55] <JimE_zOS> ticket owner rulz 
[08/31 14:56] <triveni> :)
[08/31 15:00] <triveni> well i updated the ticket.. i ll hope the job won't fail.
[08/31 15:01] <JimE_zOS> as do we all. 
[08/31 15:01] <JimE_zOS> but an update is never a bad thing 
[08/31 15:02] <triveni> ok
[08/31 15:02] <JimE_zOS> the metadata people will get worried if they don't think a fix is coming. 
[08/31 15:02] <triveni> the other job I6CROS04 has a healthy run and the app is also not in error list.. so that's good.
[08/31 15:03] <triveni> oh yes.
[08/31 15:18] <JimE_zOS> k....I need to run an errand in town...won't take long. 
[08/31 15:18] <JimE_zOS> good until I return? 
[08/31 15:18] <triveni> yes
[08/31 15:18] <triveni> i ll b here
[08/31 15:18] <triveni> thank you Jim!!
[08/31 15:19] <JimE_zOS> thanks....I won't be long

[09/01 11:16] <06Amit_ZOS> FGbg flip is done i see!
[09/01 11:16] <06Amit_ZOS> Bridge copies carrying the new personality too?
[09/01 11:17] <JimE_zOS> yes, bridge copies doing what we do during the day 
[09/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome!
[09/01 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> hope you got some good sleep then! :)
[09/01 11:18] <JimE_zOS> nope...stayed up until almost 5 working. 
[09/01 11:19] <JimE_zOS> I've got more things to code than I realized. 
[09/01 11:19] <JimE_zOS> I did a test of my new process on SYSI last night. 
[09/01 11:19] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[09/01 11:19] <JimE_zOS> worked well, but it showed me some tihngs that I'd forgotten 
[09/01 11:20] <triveni> cool
[09/01 11:20] <06Amit_ZOS> more scribbling on the board then
[09/01 11:20] <JimE_zOS> the first of which is COPY$CTL. 
[09/01 11:21] <JimE_zOS> it is way too rigid to be useful in this new mode. 
[09/01 11:21] <JimE_zOS> I don't have a whiteboard here. 
[09/01 11:21] <JimE_zOS> so I use those big 3M sticky note sheets. 
[09/01 11:22] <06Amit_ZOS> oh i have one at my place! its really usefull!
[09/01 11:22] <JimE_zOS> front hall closet door is a great place to put one. 
[09/01 11:22] <JimE_zOS> then I can pace and doodle.
[09/01 11:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Yeah!
[09/01 11:23] <triveni> m sure will get to see that on a white board.. 
[09/01 11:23] <triveni> whenver u get time
[09/01 11:23] <triveni> ;)
[09/01 11:24] <JimE_zOS> I'll have to work up a presentation. 
[09/01 11:24] <JimE_zOS> and I've already given thought to how to control your questions, Triveni. 
[09/01 11:24] <triveni> lol
[09/01 11:24] <triveni> heheheh
[09/01 11:25] <JimE_zOS> are you an American football fan? 
[09/01 11:25] <triveni> I didn't realize..people are giving so much thought in fixing me..
[09/01 11:25] <triveni> yes
[09/01 11:25] <triveni> well i like the players
[09/01 11:25] <triveni> sure the game is good too
[09/01 11:25] <triveni> ;)
[09/01 11:25] <JimE_zOS> are you familiar with the coache's challenge rule? 
[09/01 11:26] <triveni> i would like to see how will u implement in the session
[09/01 11:26] <JimE_zOS> in short, if a coach raises a good challenge, they get to make another challenge later in the half. 
[09/01 11:26] <JimE_zOS> make a bad challenge, and no more later. 
[09/01 11:26] <triveni> hahaha
[09/01 11:26] <triveni> ok
[09/01 11:26] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/01 11:26] <JimE_zOS> I'm thinking that rule could be applied to your questions too. 
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> please let him be rule free
[09/01 11:27] <JimE_zOS> ask a question ten steps ahead, no more questions. 
[09/01 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> she may not ask the coach later but she can ask the players is it?
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> if i have something to ask.. i can get my questions answer through him
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> heheeh
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> yeah i would like to use my player
[09/01 11:27] <JimE_zOS> in this case we'll modify slightly. 
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> please keep that option option
[09/01 11:27] <triveni> ;)
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> so amit can decide..if my questions are worth asking..
[09/01 11:28] <JimE_zOS> ask good question related to what we discussing, get to ask more. 
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> and pass it to coach.
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> hahaha
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> what is a good question?
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> good is a relative word 
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> heeheh
[09/01 11:28] <JimE_zOS> ask untimely questions, you'll allotement of quetions is pushed until the end of the session. 
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> i ll try to ask to meet ur relativity..
[09/01 11:28] <triveni> i ll try my best
[09/01 11:29] <JimE_zOS> so you still get to ask anything you want, but the timing might be, uhh, adjusted. 
[09/01 11:29] <triveni> ok
[09/01 11:29] <triveni> i ll note down my questions
[09/01 11:29] <triveni> and keep it till the end
[09/01 11:29] <06Amit_ZOS> I like that idea!
[09/01 11:30] <JimE_zOS> I'm still thinking through.  I don't want to be a jerk. (I know...too late), but I also don't want the session to go down a rabbit hole. 
[09/01 11:30] <triveni> but v strong urges.. i ll ask that one
[09/01 11:30] <triveni> heheh
[09/01 11:30] <triveni> your sessions will be entertaining..i know that for sure..
[09/01 11:30] <06Amit_ZOS> all your questions are strong urges!
[09/01 11:30] <triveni> its always a challenge for me..to not ask more..
[09/01 11:31] <triveni> hehehe
[09/01 11:31] <JimE_zOS> and you still can ask anything you want...we'll just help with the timing 
[09/01 11:31] <JimE_zOS> I'm thinking that you would be a bad juror. 
[09/01 11:31] <06Amit_ZOS> chances of you not asking questions in a session are the same as Charlie not adding salt in his dishes!
[09/01 11:31] <triveni> cool.. :) i ll try not to be painfully curious
[09/01 11:31] <triveni> debbie's words
[09/01 11:32] <triveni> heeheh
[09/01 11:32] <JimE_zOS> only allowed to listen while others ask questions. 
[09/01 11:32] <JimE_zOS> I do like that (painfully curious) 
[09/01 11:32] <triveni> hahaha
[09/01 11:32] <triveni> yeah.. ;)

[09/02 15:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Good afternoon!
[09/02 15:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Sorry Debbie, i had not followed up with Jim on installing the new library..
[09/02 15:06] <06Amit_ZOS> Has the rerun been done?
[09/02 15:14] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Amit
[09/02 15:14] <JimE_zOS> I have not re-run anything 
[09/02 15:15] <JimE_zOS> and now anything OPC controlled is probably out of the current plan. 
[09/02 15:15] <JimE_zOS> looking. 
[09/02 15:16] <JimE_zOS> yeah, all of EOD is done and gone from the plan. 
[09/02 15:17] <JimE_zOS> so a rerun can be done, but it won't be easy
[09/02 15:17] <JimE_zOS> although easier today than on Tuesday 
[09/02 15:17] <JimE_zOS> don't have time now (I only have 2 hours left of C1 time for testing) 
[09/02 15:18] <JimE_zOS> but if you email me the list of things to change, I can work on reruns later 
[09/02 15:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i will be hear all day Jim
[09/02 15:19] <06Amit_ZOS> we can work on it after you are done with c1 testing
[09/02 15:19] <06Amit_ZOS> that ok?
[09/02 15:20] <JimE_zOS> hard to know when that'll be, exactly. 
[09/02 15:20] <JimE_zOS> I'm juggling lots of things, Amit. 
[09/02 15:21] <JimE_zOS> still coding and devleoping, finding issues, working around them, repeat. 
[09/02 15:21] <JimE_zOS> new process is now handling all SR copies. 
[09/02 15:21] <JimE_zOS> haven't started LFD yet. 
[09/02 15:21] <JimE_zOS> and I'm still working finer points of SR stuff. 
[09/02 15:21] <02charlie> how about i help you amit, and we leave jim alone?
[09/02 15:22] <JimE_zOS> if that is OK with everybody, fine by me. 
[09/02 15:22] <JimE_zOS> I hate to dump, 
[09/02 15:22] <06Amit_ZOS> sure
[09/02 15:22] <02charlie> not a dump :)
[09/02 15:23] <JimE_zOS> when you do EOD stuff, just be careful not to impact billing. 
[09/02 15:23] <JimE_zOS> there are a number of ties there. 
[09/02 15:23] <JimE_zOS> being early in the month, GEIS will be on pins and needles. 
[09/02 15:25] <02charlie> i think the only thing that needs to be done is re-run debbies application with the library changes, so, except for the fact that these jobs will be runningm they shouldnt have an impact on billing
[09/02 15:25] <02charlie> sec
[09/02 15:26] <JimE_zOS> k....that is certainly fine. 
[09/02 15:26] <02charlie> so correct me if im wrong amit, the changes you made were to the jobs in debbie's eod application, right? for the fg/bg change?
[09/02 15:27] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/02 15:27] <06Amit_ZOS> and erjcsor
[09/02 15:27] <06Amit_ZOS> thats waynes i think
[09/02 15:27] <02charlie> hmm. sec
[09/02 15:28] <06Amit_ZOS> all required jobs are in unenmax.fgbgchg.jcllib

[09/02 15:30] <02charlie> but i dont seem to see what application they run in....sec
[09/02 15:30] <06Amit_ZOS> these are nightly jobs that need to reflect the fgbgchg

[09/02 15:44] <02charlie> so i think we wait until 1600
[09/02 15:45] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 15:47] <06Amit_ZOS> so how are we going about doing this charlie?
[09/02 15:49] <02charlie> well, i want to make sure the ERJCSOR doesn't create/change something that's critical for anything other than these reports
[09/02 15:50] <02charlie> debbie's, i just want to schedule her application, but not allow it to auto launch until we're ready
[09/02 15:50] <02charlie> but since i'm not jim, i have to walk myself thru that first
[09/02 15:51] <02charlie> if i am correct about erjcsor, we can just run that standalone
[09/02 15:52] <06Amit_ZOS> ok... ERJCSOR has a bunch of DELDSN commands where it usually deletes the SOR daily.. so we will need to rename them to something else
[09/02 15:52] <02charlie> well, i think that's because it creates a new SOR daily
[09/02 15:52] <02charlie> but i need to figure out where that gets used
[09/02 15:53] <06Amit_ZOS> oh yes.. it picks up yesterdays data regardless
[09/02 15:53] <02charlie> i also note that some of debbie's app's ran before ERJCSOR, so i'm guessing her stuff is not dpenednt on that
[09/02 15:54] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. the two are independent
[09/02 16:08] <02charlie> ok, if you look at ULESTCXJ J011642  you can see that i've verified that the only use of that dataset has been in that program
[09/02 16:08] <02charlie> (job)
[09/02 16:08] <02charlie> and i'm running ULESTCXK J012885 to do the same for PE00.LPAED.DAILY.SEARCH.ANALYSIS
[09/02 16:09] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 16:10] <06Amit_ZOS> first job, which dataset were you checking for?
[09/02 16:11] <02charlie> PE00.LPAED.SORSTAT.DAILY
[09/02 16:13] <06Amit_ZOS> thats a handy tool!
[09/02 16:14] <02charlie> yeah, if you look at SMF in my cheat sheet, it talks about that data and points to some of debbie's RPFs that extract data. I have a job in my library too
[09/02 16:16] <02charlie> and now that i'm looking at the jobs in UNENMAX.FGBGCHG.JCLLIB, none of them use opc variables, so i think you should be able to just submit them manulally, without going thru opc
[09/02 16:16] <02charlie> i would try that at least
[09/02 16:16] <06Amit_ZOS> so all we need to do is go to my library and submit them manually?
[09/02 16:16] <02charlie> you could submit the 40 job and the sor job together
[09/02 16:17] <02charlie> but i would wait on the 550 until after the 40 ends, &etc
[09/02 16:17] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 16:17] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 16:17] <02charlie> 50 not 550
[09/02 16:17] <02charlie> unless they require some sort of authorty we dont have that only opc has, that shuld work
[09/02 16:17] <06Amit_ZOS> subbd
[09/02 16:17] <02charlie> and its a bit simpler
[09/02 16:19] <06Amit_ZOS> both are running
[09/02 16:19] <02charlie> or finished
[09/02 16:19] <02charlie> sor

[09/02 16:21] <06Amit_ZOS> yes i see the stats
[09/02 16:21] <06Amit_ZOS> shall i reply to wayne?
[09/02 16:22] <02charlie> i would say so, since i received no email from him :)
[09/02 16:23] <06Amit_ZOS> i did
[09/02 16:24] <02charlie> and as i suspected 50 is dependent on 40, and 60 on 50 (at least in OPC), so i would submit each one and wait for its completion before submitting the next
[09/02 16:24] <02charlie> so 40 si done
[09/02 16:24] <02charlie> is
[09/02 16:25] <02charlie> send me a copy pls :)
[09/02 16:25] <02charlie> thx
[09/02 16:26] <06Amit_ZOS> yup
[09/02 16:26] <02charlie> now you'll want to make the changes permanent too
[09/02 16:27] <06Amit_ZOS> i had the library ready to install but i thought we will be needing to install the libraries today.. not yesterday.. and so i had not followed up with jim to find out how i needed to install these libraries
[09/02 16:27] <02charlie> and 50 is done
[09/02 16:27] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/02 16:28] <02charlie> ok, sec
[09/02 16:29] <06Amit_ZOS> to make it permanent, i just need to replace the jobs in  pt00.opca.olmr.jcllib with my jobs right?
[09/02 16:29] <06Amit_ZOS> i was not sure how this was to be implemented
[09/02 16:30] <02charlie> yeah, but before i did that, i would take the current versions of those jobs and make x members in pt00.opca.olmr.jcllib (ie., members with the first letter of the member name replaced with an x, thus XRJCSOR for ERJCSOR) 
[09/02 16:31] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 16:31] <06Amit_ZOS> so i just rename them ?
[09/02 16:31] <02charlie> depending on how you intend to replace the current versions with your members, there are several ways
[09/02 16:31] <02charlie> yes, but...
[09/02 16:32] <02charlie> this is a lla library, so changes you make will not be "seen" until you do an opcllar
[09/02 16:32] <02charlie> so here's the wai i would approach it:
[09/02 16:33] <02charlie> (1) rename the members (making sure first there isnt already an X member out there for each)
[09/02 16:33] <02charlie> (2) exit the rename of the dataset
[09/02 16:33] <02charlie> on a command line, type: tso opcllar
[09/02 16:34] <02charlie> when you go back into the dataset, you should see the x members
[09/02 16:34] <02charlie> then you can copy your dataset members to the olmr dataset
[09/02 16:34] <02charlie> then (4) you can copy your dataset members to the olmr dataset
[09/02 16:35] <02charlie> and (5) on a command line, type: tso opcllar
[09/02 16:35] <02charlie> hmm, 
[09/02 16:36] <02charlie> i wonder if step 3 might cause problems
[09/02 16:36] <02charlie> if the jobs it expects to be there arent
[09/02 16:37] <06Amit_ZOS> you mean to say  pt00.opca.olmr.jcllib is a lla library and changes wont be seen untill i do the tso opcllar?
[09/02 16:37] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 16:37] <02charlie> but wait
[09/02 16:37] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/02 16:37] <02charlie> here's the way i have always done changes  to that library
[09/02 16:37] <02charlie> (1) i go into the member I want to change
[09/02 16:38] <02charlie> (2) on the command line i type "create <membername>" where membername is my X-name, and i put c99999 on the first line of the member
[09/02 16:39] <02charlie> that should create the x-member. if i get an error, it means i have a name collision. assuming no error, i then
[09/02 16:41] <06Amit_ZOS> so you would create XERJCSOR, open it and put c9999 on the first line as a comment??
[09/02 16:41] <02charlie> (3) on the command line type "copy 'UNENMAX.FGBGCHG.JCLLIB(membername)'" and on line 1 of the current member put d99999
[09/02 16:42] <02charlie> no I would open ERJCSOR in the olmr library, and on the line number portion of the first line put c99999 
[09/02 16:42] <02charlie> and put "create XERJCSOR"
[09/02 16:43] <02charlie> and put "create XRJCSOR"
[09/02 16:43] <02charlie> alternatively, you could just open XRJCSOR in the OLMR library
[09/02 16:43] <02charlie> (which doesnt exist yet iirc)
[09/02 16:43] <02charlie> and then just say "copy ERJCSOR"
[09/02 16:43] <02charlie> which is probably simpler
[09/02 16:44] <02charlie> no need to fool with the C99999 that way
[09/02 16:44] <02charlie> c99999 is a line command which just says copy starting with this line for 99999 lines 
[09/02 16:45] <02charlie> am i making sense?
[09/02 16:46] <02charlie> and you will have name collisions for two of debbie's
[09/02 16:46] <02charlie>  Name     Prompt       Size   Created          Changed          ID   
[09/02 16:46] <02charlie> X88DSK50                233  2016/11/08  2016/11/08 12:03:19  UKAMBDS
[09/02 16:46] <02charlie> X88DSK60               3213  2016/03/28  2017/03/21 12:28:27  UKAMBDS
[09/02 16:47] <02charlie> which it's probably safe to get rid of
[09/02 16:47] <06Amit_ZOS> ok... so im gonna go into the olmr library, create a new member XERJCSOR and XRJCSOR
[09/02 16:48] <02charlie> no just XRJCSOR
[09/02 16:48] <02charlie> remember, you take the first letter and replace it with X
[09/02 16:48] <06Amit_ZOS> ok. inside XRJCSOR, i will just copy the ERJCSOR and leave it there 
[09/02 16:49] <02charlie> yep, because youre copying it from the current olmr version
[09/02 16:49] <06Amit_ZOS> yes..
[09/02 16:49] <06Amit_ZOS> and then i will do the "copy 'UNENMAX.FGBGCHG.JCLLIB(ERJCSOR)'" 
[09/02 16:49] <06Amit_ZOS> and i will be done?
[09/02 16:49] <06Amit_ZOS> (for ERJCSOR)
[09/02 16:49] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 16:50] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 16:50] <06Amit_ZOS> understood..
[09/02 16:50] <06Amit_ZOS> shall i proceed?
[09/02 16:50] <02charlie> but it your leave that member and come back, it will look like you dint make any change
[09/02 16:50] <02charlie> because at the end, we'll still need to do the opcllar
[09/02 16:50] <02charlie> yes, proceed
[09/02 16:51] <06Amit_ZOS> ok so after i do the copy from my library i will to the tso opcllar
[09/02 16:52] <02charlie> you can wait until you've done all four
[09/02 16:52] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/02 16:52] <06Amit_ZOS> will do that way
[09/02 16:53] <06Amit_ZOS> btw XRJCSOR is already there
[09/02 16:54] <06Amit_ZOS> so creating XERJCSOR
[09/02 16:54] <02charlie> no
[09/02 16:54] <06Amit_ZOS> ok..
[09/02 16:54] <06Amit_ZOS> not creating
[09/02 16:54] <02charlie> just over-write whats there
[09/02 16:54] <02charlie> XRJCSOR                 108  2003/11/10  2004/05/11 13:46:29  UEVANJR
[09/02 16:55] <06Amit_ZOS> oh.. ok.. 
[09/02 16:55] <02charlie> jim last changes ir in 20004
[09/02 16:55] <02charlie> 2004 
[09/02 16:55] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/02 16:55] <06Amit_ZOS> ok to overwrite then
[09/02 16:55] <02charlie> so i think it's safe to hose the version out there
[09/02 16:55] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 16:56] <06Amit_ZOS> create is an invalid command
[09/02 16:56] <06Amit_ZOS> tso create?
[09/02 16:57] <02charlie> no
[09/02 16:57] <02charlie> what dsn/member are you in?
[09/02 16:57] <06Amit_ZOS> PT00.OPCA.OLMR.JCLLIB
[09/02 16:57] <02charlie> member?
[09/02 16:57] <06Amit_ZOS> OOOOOOOhhhh.. now i get it
[09/02 16:58] <02charlie> :)
[09/02 16:58] <06Amit_ZOS> you just want me to get into XRJCSOR delete everything and copy the current version into that member
[09/02 16:58] <02charlie> yep
[09/02 17:10] <06Amit_ZOS> charlie, i created x88dsk40 , copied the e88dsk40 into it and saved it..
[09/02 17:10] <02charlie> good
[09/02 17:10] <06Amit_ZOS> when i check it, it still shows empty.. is it because i havent done tso opcllr yet?
[09/02 17:11] <02charlie> exactly
[09/02 17:11] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/02 17:12] <02charlie> none of your changes to that library will show up until either (1) you (or someone does) do the opcllar or (2) the lla otherwise gets refreshed 
[09/02 17:12] <06Amit_ZOS> shall i also overwrite x88dsk50 and x88dsk60?
[09/02 17:13] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 17:13] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/02 17:13] <02charlie> [09/02 16:46] <charlie>  Name     Prompt       Size   Created          Changed          ID   
[09/02 17:13] <02charlie> [09/02 16:46] <charlie> X88DSK50                233  2016/11/08  2016/11/08 12:03:19  UKAMBDS

[09/02 17:13] <02charlie> [09/02 16:47] <charlie> which it's probably safe to get rid of
[09/02 17:13] <02charlie> i think you could make all the changes, and not do the opcllar and your changes wouldnt get picked up until monday at ~ 0200
[09/02 17:14] <02charlie> but with the opcllar, opc will go and fetch any changes into its jobs so that tomorrow at ~0200 when these jobs run again, they'll use the new jcl
[09/02 17:17] <06Amit_ZOS> OK got it
[09/02 17:17] <06Amit_ZOS> so i have done all the changes
[09/02 17:18] <06Amit_ZOS> shall i do 'tso opcllar'?
[09/02 17:18] <02charlie> yes
[09/02 17:18] <06Amit_ZOS> done
[09/02 17:18] <02charlie> then you should be able to go into olmr.jcllib and find that all your changes are there
[09/02 17:18] <02charlie> both in the four members and their corresponding X members

[09/02 17:22] <02charlie> and the 40, 50 and 60 jcl should reflect the new jcl you put in there
[09/02 17:22] <02charlie> i thought you had already replied to him
[09/02 17:22] <06Amit_ZOS> not yet
[09/02 17:22] <02charlie> oh, sure
[09/02 17:22] <02charlie> copy me too, pls
[09/02 17:24] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/02 17:28] <06Amit_ZOS> Charlie, do they have a backup of these OPC libraries?
[09/02 17:28] <02charlie> you might want to mention that debbie's reports have been re-run and the opc jcl has been changed so that these changes will be permanent (until the next change)
[09/02 17:28] <02charlie> i'm sure they do, but i'm not sure where. why?
[09/02 17:29] <06Amit_ZOS> just curious..its comforting to know there are..lol ;-)
[09/02 17:29] <02charlie> yeah, i'm certain doug p knows where the backup is
[09/02 17:30] <02charlie> we're not like home users who never back up their stuff :)
[09/02 17:30] <02charlie> ok, i think you've finished what you needed to do, unless you need more of me, i'm going to step away

[09/05 03:01] <JimE_zOS> yeah, Charlie, bridge CRIT is mad 
[09/05 03:02] <Charlie_merely_lurking> something you'd like me to do?
[09/05 03:02] <JimE_zOS> an issue I thought I'd fixed by allocating the missing bridge daily LVT and correcting the JCL 
[09/05 03:02] <JimE_zOS> later today, perhaps. 
[09/05 03:02] <Charlie_merely_lurking> k
[09/05 03:03] <JimE_zOS> I'm going to have to walk through CRIT and figure out what doesn't suit him. 
[09/05 03:29] <JimE_zOS> If you haven't already done so, Charlie, I suggest we both go back to bed.

[09/05 09:28] <02charlie> wb
[09/05 09:29] <06Amit_ZOS> Thank you.. i had to postpone my CA trip by a week.. will be leaving on the 15th now
[09/05 09:30] <dsk_hbe> morning
[09/05 09:31] <dsk_hbe> oh no, Triveni... have we heard anything more???
[09/05 09:31] <02charlie> no, just the email from eric this morning
[09/05 09:31] <02charlie> good morning debbie
[09/05 09:31] <02charlie> and i sent her a text, but havent received a reply
[09/05 09:32] <02charlie> (since she emailed from her work phone)
[09/05 09:32] <dsk_hbe> I was hoping she might have contacted Amit separately... poor thing :-(
[09/05 09:32] <02charlie> yes, curious as to how it happened
[09/05 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> I am there in the loop.. it was her best friend here who contacted me..
[09/05 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> she was the one who gave me the info
[09/05 09:34] <dsk_hbe> is she ok?
[09/05 09:35] <06Amit_ZOS> she will be
[09/05 09:36] <dsk_hbe> :-(  She is going to be on my mind non-stop... I am so glad you guys have such good friends here... this is horrible to go through something like this without family.  You have family around Amit, does she?
[09/05 09:36] <06Amit_ZOS> we have a whatsapp group who is taking care of who is staying with her and helping out at the hospital.. there were a few friends who lived not very fat
[09/05 09:37] <dsk_hbe> good, good... if there is anythign we can do, please let us know.
[09/05 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes Debbie, dont worry, she will have plenty of support here!
[09/05 09:37] <02charlie> yes, indeed
[09/05 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Thank you
[09/05 09:37] <dsk_hbe> that's a comfort, thanks, Amit
[09/05 09:39] <02charlie> [09/05 09:37] <charlie> yes, indeed --> [09/05 09:37] <dsk_hbe> good, good... if there is anythign we can do, please let us know.
[09/05 09:40] <dsk_hbe> I took Charlie out of daytime and put me in and while there removed Triveni from all entries as well.
[09/05 09:40] <dsk_hbe> she doesn't need to be thinking about work
[09/05 09:40] <02charlie> k, thx
[09/05 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> i plan to leave in the afternoon to PA..
[09/05 09:41] <dsk_hbe> YOu are heading to PA this week?
[09/05 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> Will be going with another friend of hers..
[09/05 09:41] <06Amit_ZOS> to visit Triveni
[09/05 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> she is in a hospital in PA
[09/05 09:42] <dsk_hbe> oh, she is in Pennsylvania???
[09/05 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/05 09:42] <dsk_hbe> oh my... please get us the info for the hospital when you can so we can at least send flowers
[09/05 09:42] <dsk_hbe> the very least we can do :-(
[09/05 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> she is in Lehigh Valley Hospital, 1200 S Cedar Crest Blvd, Allentown, PA 18103
[09/05 09:46] <dsk_hbe> thank you!
[09/05 09:46] <02charlie> apparently she has surgery scheduled 
[09/05 09:46] <dsk_hbe> how did you fnd that out, Charlie?
[09/05 09:46] <02charlie> she responded to my text
[09/05 09:47] <02charlie> there's no one there with her :(
[09/05 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> her phone was switched off when i tried
[09/05 09:47] <dsk_hbe> oh good... is that surgery today?  Please tell her we are all thinking about her... I feel like such a Mom here... keep imagining my daughter somewhere without me trying to go through something like this :-(
[09/05 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> there is a guy named Ankush on his way there now
[09/05 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> he must not have reached..
[09/05 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> he said in the group that he will be there by 9.. he is running late i guess
[09/05 09:50] <dsk_hbe> he likely ran into rush hour traffic issues if I had to guess
[09/05 09:52] <06Amit_ZOS> just saw its an 8 hr drive from here.. need to plan this 
[09/05 09:52] <dsk_hbe> oh my
[09/05 09:53] <dsk_hbe> I keep forgetting I can email her... don't want to text her... I'll at least drop her a note now.
[09/05 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> and there are no visitors allowed in the hospital after 9 apparently
[09/05 09:54] <dsk_hbe> oh gosh... you may need to leave earlier
[09/05 09:54] <02charlie> noon at the latest
[09/05 09:55] <02charlie> and i think that will just squeak you into allentown & the hospital
[09/05 09:55] <dsk_hbe> heck, leave now
[09/05 09:55] <02charlie> and i forgot the locksmit has a trunk unlocked for us

[09/05 09:57] <02charlie> her surgey is today, but they havent finalized the time yet
[09/05 09:58] <dsk_hbe> ok, thank you!
[09/05 09:59] <02charlie> coffee
[09/05 10:00] <dsk_hbe> I just realized Amit gave more details last night in irc... neck injury... this scares me :-(  And being in ICU she likely can't accept flowers.  Amit, woudl you let us know if she is moved out of ICU?
[09/05 10:14] <Amit_away> Charlie, you are texting to her work phone right?
[09/05 10:14] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/05 10:14] <02charlie> yes
[09/05 10:16] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[09/05 10:16] <02charlie> since she had emailed eric from her work phone, i figured that was accessible
[09/05 10:16] <06Amit_zOS> smart
[09/05 10:17] <dsk_hbe> and once that hit me, I also emailed her since she can get it on her work phone.
[09/05 10:17] <06Amit_zOS> moving to office.. will meet her friend there to discuss travel plans
[09/05 10:21] <JimE_zOS> howdy

[09/05 10:25] <JimE_zOS> but mostly I like it.  
[09/05 10:25] <dsk_hbe> I know you are hoping to have some rest, but I hope you are able to spare some time to explain the changes.  Maybe other folks know what you did and I missed it due to my many vacation days :-(
[09/05 10:25] <JimE_zOS> need to build a more sophisticated control load routine for sure 
[09/05 10:25] <JimE_zOS> only the Shadow knows :-)
[09/05 10:25] <JimE_zOS> so you missed nothing. 
[09/05 10:25] <dsk_hbe> LOL!!  well, I'll ask him (that's one of my cat's names ;-)
[09/05 10:26] <JimE_zOS> (that is a line from an old radio show, BTW) 
[09/05 10:26] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 10:26] <dsk_hbe> he's not answering me ;-/
[09/05 10:26] <02charlie> that's because only the shadow knows

[09/05 10:28] <06Amit_ZOS> back
[09/05 10:29] <02charlie> he did Red October
[09/05 10:29] <02charlie> a movie i watch every time it's on
[09/05 10:29] <02charlie> well-crafted adaptaion of the tom clancy novel
[09/05 10:30] <02charlie> adaptation
[09/05 10:30] <06Amit_ZOS> hello Jim
[09/05 10:30] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, I am thinking the FABC issues you had might be related to 'CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG' mess up... somethign about this sounds familiar... Jim, did we have issues before when the metadata folks asked for fabc bounces after midnight but before FABC EOD?  seems vaguely familiar
[09/05 10:30] * Amit_away has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[09/05 10:30] <02charlie> and im sighing at the middleware t/o report 
[09/05 10:31] <02charlie> i may steal that ticket away from lexis search engine
[09/05 10:32] <dsk_hbe> oh... related to your problems?  I am still torn over being paged for something like that and lettign it at least sit quietly in an unpagable queue until we notice it :-/
[09/05 10:32] <JimE_zOS> I'm guessing that when OPS started FABC copies manually (no, No, NO!!) they defeated and confused the FABC OPC applications. 
[09/05 10:33] <dsk_hbe> oh they did???  well there ya go :-(
[09/05 10:33] <dsk_hbe> just when we think we have them trained someone new (I hope it was someone new) comes along
[09/05 10:35] <dsk_hbe> of course if metadata is doign bounces earlier than normal, maybe those late night shifts aren't as familiar
[09/05 10:39] <02charlie> I thought I saw OPC restart code in that job to restart if an S222 occurs
[09/05 10:39] <02charlie> so it may have been that opc restarted the task, but ops replied to the date may be wrong message
[09/05 10:40] <dsk_hbe> I did see in one of the fabfd83 runs that no one replied to the wto
[09/05 10:40] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I don't think I restart for an operator cancel. 
[09/05 10:41] <JimE_zOS> if OPS wants the thing down, it seems wrong of my to blindly restart. 
[09/05 10:42] <dsk_hbe> this one:
[09/05 10:42] <dsk_hbe> 02.47.34 S0062652 *415 CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG. ACCEPT IT? (Y OR N)
[09/05 10:42] <dsk_hbe> 04.46.02 S0062652  LEXM03 COMMAND - EOJ
[09/05 10:43] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... and also this one:
[09/05 10:43] <dsk_hbe> 03.46.07 S0106355 *057 CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG. ACCEPT IT? (Y OR N)
[09/05 10:43] <dsk_hbe> 04.46.03 S0106355  LEXM03 COMMAND - EOJ
[09/05 10:43] <02charlie> oh, you're right. restart on 1001, S026, U045 and U021
[09/05 10:43] <JimE_zOS> yeah, no auto-restart on 222, Charlie
[09/05 10:43] <02charlie> jinx
[09/05 10:44] <JimE_zOS> if we are getting that message, strongly suggests that CRIT/COLD are out of cycle. 
[09/05 10:44] <dsk_hbe> both of those were the s222s
[09/05 10:44] <JimE_zOS> and the fact that today's FABC start application arrived at 07:15(ish) instead of 04:45(ish) tells me we are goofed. 
[09/05 10:44] <dsk_hbe> I think 7:15 is when Cjharlie got it moving again
[09/05 10:45] <02charlie> yes
[09/05 10:46] <02charlie> i couldnt remeber that i had to put ro sysj, in front of my modify command, so i had to at to each box to execute the modify
[09/05 10:46] <JimE_zOS> # ro sysj,f fabfd......
[09/05 10:47] <02charlie> yeah, i know that now :)
[09/05 10:47] <JimE_zOS> ro being short for route 
[09/05 10:47] <JimE_zOS> and these cancels....hmmm...let me look at something. 
[09/05 10:47] <02charlie> yeah, i was trying f sysj,fabfc85j,eoj whihc, of  course, didnt work
[09/05 10:48] <02charlie> bcp in 12 minutes
[09/05 10:48] <02charlie> (meeting, not the exercise :)
[09/05 10:49] <dsk_hbe> I swear that gave me a second of fear ;-)
[09/05 10:49] <06Amit_ZOS> Is prod also goofed up? or is it just fabc?
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> second rule, Amit, prod is always fine :-)
[09/05 10:50] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> the cancels are me, BTW
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> (04:48:19) Cancelling un-responsive task(s)...

[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> (04:48:19) Cancelling un-responsive task(s)...Completed      
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> (04:48:19) Looking for un-responsive tasks...                
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS>            FABFD87G is no longer active.                     
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> (04:49:04) Looking for un-responsive tasks...Completed       
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> from the code I wrote to stop processes
[09/05 10:50] <dsk_hbe> so fallout need of them not answering the WTO likely?
[09/05 10:50] <JimE_zOS> come along peacefully, or I call the sheriff. 
[09/05 10:50] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 10:51] <JimE_zOS> so why is it that all of hte sudden those copies are "unresponsive"? 
[09/05 10:51] <dsk_hbe> <dsk_hbe> so fallout need of them not answering the WTO likely?
[09/05 10:51] <dsk_hbe> they never get to start-up complete
[09/05 10:51] <02charlie> and what is your criteria for "non-responsive"?
[09/05 10:52] <JimE_zOS> I issue a quiesce or EOJ and the copy doesn't come out of hte system in a timely fashion. 
[09/05 10:53] <JimE_zOS> yeah, here: 
[09/05 10:53] <JimE_zOS> (04:46:04) Evaluating 259 active tasks...              
[09/05 10:53] <JimE_zOS>            FABFD87G -- DBMT001I F FABFD87G,EOJ         
[09/05 10:53] <JimE_zOS> me asking nicely 
[09/05 10:54] <JimE_zOS> me calling the sheriff
[09/05 10:54] <JimE_zOS> (04:48:19) Cancelling un-responsive task(s)...         
[09/05 10:54] <JimE_zOS>            FABFD87G -- DBMT001I C FABFD87G             
[09/05 10:54] <JimE_zOS> I vote that any copy that fails to honor an EOJ request in 2 minutes is "unresponsive"
[09/05 10:59] <02charlie> i agree
[09/05 11:04] <02charlie> so ops restarted the canceled tasks then 
[09/05 11:04] <02charlie> :(
[09/05 11:04] <02charlie> oh, and LDC is not in the BCP exercise
[09/05 11:05] <dsk_hbe> interesting... I guess they hope no crisis before we retire t and are trusting that retirement deadline (silly people ;-)
[09/05 11:06] <06Amit_ZOS> They hope to retire it by the end of the year right?
[09/05 11:07] <dsk_hbe> I am thinking they are now saying 1Q18 or 1Q18?  Can't recall... it keeps moving
[09/05 11:07] <dsk_hbe> oops... or 2Q18
[09/05 11:08] <dsk_hbe> yeah, 1Q18 per some notes I jotted down
[09/05 11:08] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/05 11:11] <dsk_hbe> in another non-work disaster discussion... my Aunt who narrowly missed the eye of Harvey has a half sister who lives in Puerto Rico.  They now have Irma reading at a Cat5 :-(
[09/05 11:12] <02charlie> ah, here's the list for the products https://reedelsevier.sharepoint.com/sites/RETSTeamDept/retsdr/DRtests/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1B9B07B4-0934-4591-B480-C82C8E48CAC2%7D&file=LN%20DR%20Test%20Objectives%20Master%20List%202H%202017%20Test.xlsx&action=default
[09/05 11:12] <02charlie> and i heard irma has winds gusting to 215 mph
[09/05 11:12] <dsk_hbe> yikes!
[09/05 11:12] <02charlie> and it's headed straght for PR :(
[09/05 11:13] <dsk_hbe> yeah... how do you evacuate from there... scary
[09/05 11:13] <06Amit_ZOS> goodness..
[09/05 11:15] <dsk_hbe> so TP isn't in the test, Charlie?  Interesting.
[09/05 11:15] <02charlie> apparently not
[09/05 11:15] <dsk_hbe> can't say I'm sad to hear that
[09/05 11:19] <JimE_zOS> sorry....call from Kerri. 
[09/05 11:20] <02charlie> thye still dont know which pulse secure client we should use
[09/05 11:20] <JimE_zOS> sharing: Kerri tells me that OPS has lost 28 Manila resources. 
[09/05 11:21] <JimE_zOS> 5 leave this week and the rest on Oct 1st. 
[09/05 11:21] <02charlie> sheesh
[09/05 11:21] <02charlie> what caused that?
[09/05 11:21] <JimE_zOS> so....they are in a mad rush to automate everything possible. 
[09/05 11:21] <JimE_zOS> I can't say, Charlie.  She didn't offer and I didn't ask. 
[09/05 11:22] <JimE_zOS> maybe the Manila resources were needed by some other group more. 
[09/05 11:22] <JimE_zOS> just don't know. 
[09/05 11:22] <dsk_hbe> wow
[09/05 11:23] <JimE_zOS> but the fact that SR start-up is now completely automated was on her wish list. 
[09/05 11:24] <02charlie> ok, anyone mind if i run this tv to the repair shop?
[09/05 11:24] <06Amit_ZOS> So no more oper's in the startup ?
[09/05 11:24] <JimE_zOS> not for the SRs, no. 
[09/05 11:24] <JimE_zOS> during my next oncall week, I'll do more. 
[09/05 11:25] <JimE_zOS> LFD, SA and autoCRIT/autoCOLD is my goal 
[09/05 11:25] <06Amit_ZOS> let me know if I can help in anyway Jim
[09/05 11:25] <JimE_zOS> I won't have firm plans until I can sleep through the night. 
[09/05 11:26] <06Amit_ZOS> sleep is essential for strong thought
[09/05 11:26] <dsk_hbe> you are a miracle worker, Jim!
[09/05 11:26] <JimE_zOS> it depends, Amit. 
[09/05 11:27] <JimE_zOS> some things I can do while sleepy, some not. 
[09/05 11:27] <02charlie> ok, anyone mind if i run this tv to the repair shop?
[09/05 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> some things that dont need strong thought! lol.. those have become second nature to you
[09/05 11:27] <JimE_zOS> looking at LVT offsets and trying to figure out what we have done to the STCK at that location, is a well rested thing
[09/05 11:27] <06Amit_ZOS> go ahead charlie! :)
[09/05 11:27] <dsk_hbe> okbyme, Charlie!
[09/05 11:28] <02charlie> thx, be back asap
[09/05 11:28] <JimE_zOS> did we put the FABC thing to bed? 
[09/05 11:29] <02charlie> TV guy wont be in the shop until 1215 so i'll leave about noon
[09/05 11:29] <dsk_hbe> I'm not sure we did... if you think it is out of sorts, maybe not
[09/05 11:30] <02charlie> well, jim's automation canceled it, but ops restarted it
[09/05 11:30] <02charlie> we need to keep them from doing that
[09/05 11:30] <02charlie> let me check smf and see how they restarted it
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> this morning's copy Charlie EOJ'd still had the date missmatch:
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> 05.38.47 S0171430 *130 CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG. ACCEPT IT? (Y OR N)
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> 05.39.17 S0171430  R 130,Y
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> 05.39.17 S0171430  TEST   053917 8324 START-UP COMPLETE, SCHEDULE = 12:00 A.M. TO  3:45 P.M. CLUSTR=
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> 07.07.53 S0171430  LEXM03 COMMAND - EOJ
[09/05 11:31] <dsk_hbe> but maybe since they replied to it we are good?
[09/05 11:32] <dsk_hbe> to the WTO that is
[09/05 11:32] <JimE_zOS> I just put syntax errors in all of hte FABC SA/LFD startup procs 
[09/05 11:32] <JimE_zOS> so no manual START command will work for them. 
[09/05 11:32] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, a question about the ERJCSOR.. can you give me an approximate of search volume on a typical bussiness day?
[09/05 11:32] <dsk_hbe> cool
[09/05 11:32] <JimE_zOS> and since the JCL used by OPC is in our JCLLIB (SKLIB, actually), OPS can't goof with that. 
[09/05 11:33] <dsk_hbe> let me see if I can find you a chart for that Amit... Wayne's group keeps daily stats
[09/05 11:33] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, i didnt know which features/columns are more important than the others..
[09/05 11:34] <dsk_hbe> here is the main link to their docs.. might be the one named 'searches' that tell you - https://lngdevelopment.lexisnexis.com/sites/SU/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fSU%2fShared%20Documents%2fProduction%20Performance%20documents&FolderCTID=0x0120004E0CD90EE5B4C24C900DF5193DC2D6BA&View=%7b3D11235B%2d5A05%2d42BE%2dA6EB%2dCAFD540A4786%7d
[09/05 11:35] <dsk_hbe> also, Wayne sent me some cool stats this morning showing we are making better use of our CPUs... I'll share that, sec.
[09/05 11:38] <dsk_hbe> had to restart outlook.  wouldn't let me send.
[09/05 11:38] <dsk_hbe> Anyway, that 'searches' doc looks to be the right one.  I am fairly certain he pulls those stats from erjcsor
[09/05 11:53] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks Debbie
[09/05 11:53] <dsk_hbe> sure thing
[09/05 11:54] <06Amit_ZOS> i just got more updates, the surgery for her thigh injury will probably happen sometime today evening or tomorrow morning
[09/05 11:54] <dsk_hbe> please travel safely in case I miss you leaving, Amit
[09/05 11:54] <06Amit_ZOS> there are no signs of internal bleeding
[09/05 11:54] <dsk_hbe> thank goodness for that
[09/05 11:54] <02charlie> oh, that's good
[09/05 11:54] <02charlie> and thx for the update. pls keep us posted
[09/05 11:55] <06Amit_ZOS> neck is right now supported and will be taking MRI scans today and will be under monitoring
[09/05 11:55] <06Amit_ZOS> either way, i think she will have to be at the hospital for atleast couple more days
[09/05 11:55] <dsk_hbe> so hoping for good results on the neck testing
[09/05 11:55] <06Amit_ZOS> Ankush has reached there and he is the one giving the info
[09/05 11:56] <dsk_hbe> oh good... hate thinking she is alone
[09/05 11:56] <dsk_hbe> and I am sorry to forget asking... the driver, are they ok?
[09/05 11:56] <06Amit_ZOS> I guess i should Eric know as well
[09/05 11:57] <dsk_hbe> he can't share due to HIPAA rules but I am sure he'd be glad to hear some good news
[09/05 11:57] <02charlie> glad ankush made it
[09/05 11:57] <02charlie> she should not be alone
[09/05 11:58] <02charlie> if you find out what happened let us know
[09/05 11:58] <06Amit_ZOS> the driver has also sustained severe injuries including a fracture in his chest and there is some internal bleeding.. the girl who was in the passenger seat thankfully got away with minor injuries and just has some body pain
[09/05 11:58] <02charlie> ok, now i'll head to the tv shop
[09/05 11:58] * charlie is now known as charlie_away
[09/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> oh my, scary stuff... glad to hear one of them is doing ok
[09/05 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> it seems it was a head on collision with another car.. by the sound of it, he got on the wrong side of the road after taking an exit because the divider was not very visible
[09/05 11:59] <dsk_hbe> oh my
[09/05 12:21] <06Amit_ZOS> brb

[09/05 12:45] <02charlie> oh, that's bad
[09/05 12:46] <02charlie> hopefully, no alcohol involved
[09/05 12:57] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 12:58] <02charlie> great list of jokes, debbie, and you're right, right up my alley. George Takei has some great things, almost always funny stuff
[09/05 13:10] <02charlie> hmm INC01629889 Priority 3
[09/05 13:12] <dsk_hbe> sorry, had a call... so you'd seen thatlist before?  If not, I suspect you have possibly run across most of the jokes ;-)
[09/05 13:12] <dsk_hbe> that is interesting on teh ticket.  Maybe someone rightfully reduced sev
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> yeah, and i like this comment: Punsalang, Maica A. (REPH-MNL) 
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> Additional comments 
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> 2017-09-04 04:33:35
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> a day
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> The system has a daily downtime from 04:45 to 05:00 every morning, but not sure why sessions are reporting inactive starting 02:47. Will check if the sessions will become active after 05:00.
[09/05 13:12] <02charlie> so she's paying attention
[09/05 13:13] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[09/05 13:25] <JimE_zOS> not ready to do this, but my new stuff will let us bridge FABC, if we want to do so. 
[09/05 13:25] <dsk_hbe> oh cool!
[09/05 13:25] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/05 13:25] <JimE_zOS> DW too, but I'm gonna need lots of cash to make that happen. 
[09/05 13:25] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 13:25] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/05 13:26] <02charlie> im just puzzled, because FDs 83, 85 and 87 werent responding because they were waiting for the operator reply, eg
[09/05 13:26] <02charlie> 87G:
[09/05 13:26] <02charlie> 02.51.43 S0066359 *272 CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG. ACCEPT IT? (Y OR N)   
[09/05 13:26] <02charlie> 04.46.04 S0066359  LEXM03 COMMAND - EOJ                                 
[09/05 13:27] <dsk_hbe> that's what I said above for 83
[09/05 13:27] <dsk_hbe> twice that happened... so that may be what caused the whole mess
[09/05 13:27] <02charlie> 85G:
[09/05 13:27] <02charlie> 02.49.40 S0064818 *288 CURRENT DATE MAY BE WRONG. ACCEPT IT? (Y OR N)  
[09/05 13:27] <02charlie> 04.46.02 S0064818  LEXM03 COMMAND - EOJ                                
[09/05 13:27] <02charlie> but there were fd copies still avaiable
[09/05 13:27] <dsk_hbe> cl9?
[09/05 13:27] <02charlie> yes
[09/05 13:28] <JimE_zOS> but in FABC, those don't cross over. 
[09/05 13:28] <dsk_hbe> that is why I guessed the reason the cl8 copies were bouncing was for metadata.
[09/05 13:28] <JimE_zOS> Clusters 8 and 9 have unique connectivity to test different things for Bobbie K. 
[09/05 13:28] <dsk_hbe> the two clusters are used for different types of metadata checkout I believe
[09/05 13:28] <02charlie> ah
[09/05 13:28] <dsk_hbe> jinx!
[09/05 13:28] <02charlie> so the psc1870/1 copies only connect to CL8?
[09/05 13:28] <dsk_hbe> release vs. update kinda thing
[09/05 13:29] <JimE_zOS> and if the copies were back up and running when COLD ran, the LVTs wouldn't get the new days values 
[09/05 13:29] <JimE_zOS> I forget exactly, Charlie (RE: connectivity) 
[09/05 13:29] <dsk_hbe> ditto
[09/05 13:29] <dsk_hbe> I'd guess we have them all connected the same
[09/05 13:29] <JimE_zOS> just have in your mind that in FABC an LFD is not an LFD :-)
[09/05 13:29] <dsk_hbe> TA-wise
[09/05 13:29] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 13:29] <02charlie> ok
[09/05 13:30] <JimE_zOS> so, copies up and running when COLD ran?   Do we think that happened? 
[09/05 13:30] <02charlie> i dont think so
[09/05 13:30] <02charlie> im trying t remeber what i saw monday morning
[09/05 13:31] <02charlie> too bad i didnt get a screenshot
[09/05 13:31] <02charlie> im thinking cold was still in W status
[09/05 13:31] <dsk_hbe> the s222's both happened at 04:48
[09/05 13:31] <02charlie> because START was still in S status because of the three copies
[09/05 13:32] <02charlie> is cold dependent upon start completing?
[09/05 13:32] <02charlie> lmc
[09/05 13:32] <JimE_zOS> it is, in a roundabout way 
[09/05 13:32] <JimE_zOS> CRIT wont' run until the START app goes to complete. 
[09/05 13:32] <JimE_zOS> and COLD won't start until CRIT completes. 
[09/05 13:33] <02charlie> so then my recollection that CRI and COLD were in W status should be correct
[09/05 13:34] <02charlie> because i didnt actually add another copy of STOP to the CP when I recognized that START still had those three jobs in S status. I figured i's try EOJing them first and see if that took care of it
[09/05 13:35] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah, it did happen. 
[09/05 13:35] <JimE_zOS> this morning, FABC cold started at 07.11.59 
[09/05 13:36] <JimE_zOS> oh, I lied
[09/05 13:36] <JimE_zOS> can't tell time, I guess. 
[09/05 13:36] <JimE_zOS> ignore me. 
[09/05 13:36] <dsk_hbe> I seriously think this was all due to metadata requesting a bounce after midnight/before EOD beacuase we don't normally do that... and didn't help that OPS didn't reply to WTO
[09/05 13:37] <dsk_hbe> it just seems like we ran into this before
[09/05 13:37] <dsk_hbe> it is bugging me... gonna try to find that memory
[09/05 13:37] <JimE_zOS> I think what we ran into before was a rename running (taking teh FABC sysrale away from us) and having a copy bounce afterwards and fail to restart. 
[09/05 13:38] <JimE_zOS> missing critical system file, and all. 
[09/05 13:38] <dsk_hbe> hmmmm... maybe so
[09/05 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni is in for her surgery btw
[09/05 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> for the leg
[09/05 13:38] <dsk_hbe> so sooner than they were saying... thank you AMit
[09/05 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> she will be done by 3 pm
[09/05 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> and there are 2 friends with her now
[09/05 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> that calms me down a bit
[09/05 13:40] <JimE_zOS> yeah....glad she isn't alone. 
[09/05 13:40] <JimE_zOS> she'll need to ask questions when she wakes up.  :-)
[09/05 13:40] <06Amit_zOS> sorry i have not been following along as well as i can with the FABC issue with these things going on.. I promise to bug you guys later regarding this issue
[09/05 13:41] <JimE_zOS> I'm hoping that by keeping OPS from starting FABC copies outside of OPC control we'll be better. 
[09/05 13:42] <dsk_hbe> found the log entry... was mine from early this year... will share just for completeness and to confirm Jim's memory is way better than mine
[09/05 13:47] <JimE_zOS> I don't feel good about this FABC issue, but I really need to get back to bridge CRIT. 
[09/05 13:47] <dsk_hbe> yeah, much more importsnt
[09/05 13:47] <JimE_zOS> I'll keep FABC in mind, of course. 
[09/05 13:48] <dsk_hbe> I'm hopng the fact they responded to the WTO this morning makes all the difference
[09/05 13:48] <dsk_hbe> though still not liking that there was one to respond to
[09/05 13:49] <dsk_hbe> but if metadata asked for a bounce, there certainly woudl be
[09/05 13:49] <06Amit_zOS> whats WTO?
[09/05 13:49] <dsk_hbe> write to operator
[09/05 13:49] <06Amit_zOS> ah
[09/05 13:49] <dsk_hbe> code that can tell OPS we need a reply from you
[09/05 13:49] <06Amit_zOS> ok
[09/05 13:51] <06Amit_zOS> lunch
[09/05 13:54] <02charlie> hmm, maybe (FABC) CRIT can run before START completes, but COLD waits on CRIT to complete
[09/05 13:55] <JimE_zOS> nope. 
[09/05 13:56] <JimE_zOS> now that said, if the START application is from the WRONG day, the current day CRIT won't wait 
[09/05 13:56] <JimE_zOS> that could happen. 
[09/05 13:57] <JimE_zOS> the other thing that can happen, if copies are started outside of OPC, OPC is unaware that they are running. 
[09/05 13:58] <JimE_zOS> so dependencies that really shouldn't have completed do complete because OPC is out of the loop. 
[09/05 13:58] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, I looked at syslog earlier for 83C and didn't get the feeling that was the case, though someone shoudl check me before beliveing me
[09/05 14:00] <JimE_zOS> and RE: Charlie's theory, I"ll point out that CRIT isn't the thing that matters in the "wrong date" WTOR.  It is COLD. 
[09/05 14:00] <JimE_zOS> a fresh LVT and the date prompt will be never be issued. 
[09/05 14:00] <02charlie> yeah
[09/05 14:01] <02charlie> but if you bouce the fd after midnight, you'll get the message, right?
[09/05 14:02] <02charlie> if i'm reading this right, these are all successor dependencies?

[09/05 14:03] <02charlie> but i dont see any predecessors
[09/05 14:04] <dsk_hbe> yes, you bounce after midnight you get that message... which is why I'm still going to guess it's related to that and OPS not answering the WTO.  
[09/05 14:04] <dsk_hbe> something is missing in my thinking though and I haven't figured out what!
[09/05 14:05] <dsk_hbe> but before I forget, Charlie, I have to leave right at 3 for a doc appointment.  Can I put you back in daytime when I go?
[09/05 14:05] <02charlie> i agree with your theory tho, especially since FABC applies the rule to never cross the beams :)
[09/05 14:05] <02charlie> absolutely
[09/05 14:05] <dsk_hbe> thanks!
[09/05 14:05] <dsk_hbe> I can't believe it's already after2!
[09/05 14:06] <02charlie> i have a clock that chimes next to my left ear
[09/05 14:12] <dsk_hbe> I've got one right across the wall from me that chimes and still I missed it... my stomach alarm went off or I'd have missed my appointment!
[09/05 14:12] <02charlie> lol
[09/05 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> back
[09/05 14:41] <02charlie> debbie, do you think it's the same scenario? I see this in the job log for fabfd03C: 03.46.05 S0106355  TEST   034605 8302 SYSRALE =13.55|DATE=2017248|TIME=03185064  
[09/05 14:42] <02charlie> it doesnt appear to be complaining about any missing files
[09/05 14:42] <dsk_hbe> I don't think so but I may have missed something.  I searched for the rename via eqqaudio and didn't find it.  I don't know when they rename that particular metadata
[09/05 14:43] <dsk_hbe> that was a n abend situation due to not finding the renamed file... I think we were past that as far as the copy start-up... I am still thinking just the non-responsive copy due to it not achieving start-up complete
[09/05 14:43] <dsk_hbe> I may be very wrong
[09/05 14:44] <02charlie> and i am still agreeing with that theory
[09/05 14:44] <02charlie> i think the data fits that explanation
[09/05 14:44] <02charlie> amit, you're not going to make the hospital at 9pm
[09/05 14:49] <02charlie> 15- minutes and youre a pumpkin, debbie
[09/05 14:49] <02charlie> (my clock is apparently 4 minutes slow)
[09/05 14:49] <dsk_hbe> I know!  I am fighting excel... I hate excel!!!
[09/05 14:50] <06Amit_zOS> yes i know, I am going to wait.. I don't think me being there today will make any difference because she is heavily sedated and she is with friends from her grad school
[09/05 14:50] <02charlie> ok, good (friends there)
[09/05 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> plus 8 hrs up and down before the weekend and going to buffalo after that seems a lot more taxing right now
[09/05 14:51] <dsk_hbe> that's just too much driving :-(
[09/05 14:51] <06Amit_zOS> it doesnt help if i tire myself out too
[09/05 14:52] <02charlie> yes
[09/05 14:52] <02charlie> that's a lot of driving
[09/05 14:52] <02charlie> speaking of which, i was going to ask if i could switch this weekend with someone else's weekend, but it looks like kate wont need me there this weekend
[09/05 14:53] <06Amit_zOS> I will be of better help once she is done with the medical procedures and needs daytoday help here..
[09/05 14:53] <02charlie> and i dont know if i'll have a connection the entire route, and i know they wont have internet immediately in the apt
[09/05 14:54] <06Amit_zOS> Go for your doc appointment Debbie, have a good day! 
[09/05 14:55] <dsk_hbe> if you find you do need a swap, Charlie, let me know.  I'd have to check with Stu to see what we have going, but might be able to 
[09/05 14:56] <dsk_hbe> oh but I do have a borthday dinner this Friday for my daughter
[09/05 14:56] <02charlie> well, at the moment she's thinking she'll pick up cheap furniture at goodwill/SVDP or some such place
[09/05 14:56] <02charlie> that way, there's no need to haul anything out to omaha
[09/05 14:57] <dsk_hbe> oh smart
[09/05 15:01] <dsk_hbe> OK, you are back in daytime, Charlie; thanks!  Thanks for keeping us informed on Triveni, Amit.  I sure do appreciate it!
[09/05 15:01] * dsk_hbe is now known as dsk_away
[09/05 15:01] <02charlie> thx & bye debbie
[09/05 15:01] <dsk_away> bye!!
[09/05 15:15] <JimE_zOS> Charlie?  Do you mind if I put in a non-emergency F-Card rename this week?  
[09/05 15:15] <02charlie> not at all, and i need to get to wayne's ritm too
[09/05 15:15] <JimE_zOS> I want to change some J-Cards from "M" to "A" for some CRE SR copies. 
[09/05 15:16] <JimE_zOS> would you like me to do a change request for both? 
[09/05 15:16] <JimE_zOS> or would you rather those be different nights? 
[09/05 15:17] <02charlie> i dont see why we couldnt do them both the same night
[09/05 15:17] <02charlie> yeah, i know it means changing more than one thing at a time, but i dont see that they would make a significant effect on each other that would cause me concern
[09/05 15:18] <JimE_zOS> k....then I'll work up a single change for both. 
[09/05 15:18] <02charlie> so one for both would be good
[09/05 15:18] <JimE_zOS> non-emergency 
[09/05 15:18] <02charlie> thx
[09/05 15:18] <JimE_zOS> no....thank you. :-)
[09/05 15:18] <02charlie> and maybe if we put the magic "f-card" word in the short desc, ops will take care of it? ;-)
[09/05 15:19] <JimE_zOS> fear not, I plan to do exactly that. 
[09/05 15:19] <02charlie> i knew you would :)
[09/05 15:50] <JimE_zOS> k, I think I have a handle on the bridge CRIT issue. 
[09/05 15:51] <JimE_zOS> I've made both in-plan and permanent dependency changes to address. 
[09/05 15:51] <02charlie> it was a dependency issue?
[09/05 15:53] <06Amit_zOS> just fyi i have the updated chk$dry in here: UNENMAX.ISPF.EXEC(CHK$DRY)
[09/05 15:53] <06Amit_zOS> it reflects the current fg/bg config
[09/05 15:54] <02charlie> ah thx
[09/05 15:54] <JimE_zOS> chk$dry....good point, Amit. 
[09/05 15:54] <JimE_zOS> hadn't considered that. 
[09/05 15:54] <JimE_zOS> yes, Charlie, I think it was 
[09/05 15:54] <JimE_zOS> a mildly distasteful mix of new and old bridging.
[09/05 15:55] <JimE_zOS> and this helps me understand why it never happened when I ran this process manually. 
[09/05 15:55] <JimE_zOS> because I just happened to do it late enough that it didn't matter
[09/05 15:55] <02charlie> ah
[09/05 16:23] <06Amit_zOS> all fg copies today peaked (ARTwise) at 14:00 -14:30 -14:40 all of them >0.1

[09/05 16:29] <02charlie> i was modifying my version of chk$dry to match the changes for the BG copies
[09/05 16:31] <06Amit_zOS> I see.. yes.. you and I have the same version i think
[09/05 16:32] <02charlie> no, mine's slightly different
[09/05 16:33] <06Amit_zOS> after you made the changes to accomodate the lcre stuff i had copied it from yours.. after that if you had made a change, it would be different
[09/05 16:33] <02charlie> yep
[09/05 16:33] <02charlie> you can run a compare
[09/05 16:34] <02charlie> i mostly just added description of the sort criteria, so i wouldnt have to remember
[09/05 16:36] <06Amit_zOS> got it

[09/06 09:07] <02charlie> no one restarted fabc last night after nidmight

[09/06 09:35] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[09/06 09:35] <dsk_hbe> morning
[09/06 09:36] <dsk_hbe> I took Charlie out of daytime and put me in.
[09/06 09:37] <dsk_hbe> that's the Arachnys ID, Amit (BTMC8J).  He must have been extra busy yesterday! %-/
[09/06 09:37] <dsk_hbe> glad to see FABC behaved today!
[09/06 09:38] <02charlie> thx debbie
[09/06 09:39] <dsk_hbe> I got a repply from the email I sent Triveni.  SO glad to see words directly from her... makes me feel so much better!
[09/06 09:41] <02charlie> how's she doing, does she say?
[09/06 09:41] <dsk_hbe> no, just thanked me for the note and signed it with a smiley.  That alone comforted me :-)
[09/06 09:42] <dsk_hbe> anything we can help you with on the pscz1871/2 question to JimC, Charlie?  We're in charge of it's qlrb env, if that is what you are asking him about?
[09/06 09:42] <dsk_hbe> plumbing could be so many things though :-)
[09/06 09:43] <02charlie> ah, jim just sent me the connection table
[09/06 09:43] <02charlie> which is what i was looking for
[09/06 09:44] <dsk_hbe> okie dokie...
[09/06 09:44] <02charlie> i was disturbed by the PSA t/o note
[09/06 09:44] <dsk_hbe> which one... they send out so many ;-)
[09/06 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> Yes debbie! got it.. he has been busy in the recent past
[09/06 09:44] <dsk_hbe> I'll finish catchign up on email ;-)
[09/06 09:44] <02charlie> they said the connections started going inactive about 0345 (the latest note)
[09/06 09:45] <dsk_hbe> ah ok
[09/06 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> I dropped her best friend to the airport today morning.. she will be joining her too today
[09/06 09:45] <02charlie> but i dont see that any of the copies were restarted like yesterday or the day before
[09/06 09:45] <02charlie> excellent amit
[09/06 09:45] <dsk_hbe> probably drops on the web side then, huh?
[09/06 09:45] <dsk_hbe> oh good, Amit!  Do you know if her parents are going to try to get here?
[09/06 09:45] <02charlie> maybe, but it makes me go hmm, and want to investigate
[09/06 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> Im am not sure at this point.. i certainly hope so..
[09/06 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> hows the roundtable going charlie?
[09/06 09:50] <dsk_hbe> hope so too, Amit
[09/06 09:52] <dsk_hbe> dunno if it will be related, Charlie, but in case you missed it, they backed out the August release TOC changes.  They were supposed to fix the hung thread issues, but were causing continual copy bounces, in prod anyway... so now we are back to the hung thread issue
[09/06 09:53] <02charlie> ahhhh, that might explain it, but that shouldnt cause the FD connections to go inactive
[09/06 09:55] <dsk_hbe> no, unless they are confused on what was inactive.  We do only run the 3 CL8 copies and I see in their ticket they show 80 and 81 too.  Not clear to me if those are the ones they are referring to though
[09/06 09:56] <02charlie> yeah, it will take a little more exploration
[09/06 09:56] <dsk_hbe> yeah, have fun ;-)
[09/06 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> I feel like John Watson with 3 other sherlock holmes in the team!
[09/06 09:56] <dsk_hbe> LOL... nah, you are clearly catchign on to our ways ;-)
[09/06 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Charlie halfway looks like one too!
[09/06 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> she just misses that jacket!
[09/06 09:57] <02charlie> lol
[09/06 09:57] <dsk_hbe> LOL!!!  he just needs one of those silly hats and a curcy pipe ;-)
[09/06 09:57] <dsk_hbe> curvy
[09/06 09:57] <02charlie> i've got a silly hat somewhere i think
[09/06 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Get that winter Jacket Charlie! you will look awesome in it! 
[09/06 09:57] <02charlie> and maybe an old pipe, but i think those are all gone :)
[09/06 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS> i would suggest a pipe if you smoked !
[09/06 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS> jinx!
[09/06 10:01] <dsk_hbe> oh and BTW, Charlie, I don't think TOC talks directly to LFD anyway... sounding more like a red herring comment from them than anything ;-)
[09/06 10:02] <dsk_hbe> I bet she meant 04:45 ;-)
[09/06 10:02] <02charlie> well, that's good, because any comment you put my name into turns red in irc :)
[09/06 10:03] <02charlie> well that would make more sense, and be consistent with what i currently know
[09/06 10:03] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[09/06 10:05] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, we talked about some training on SORs, etc.  Do you want to talk a little this week or do you think its best to wait for Triveni to be back?
[09/06 10:06] <dsk_hbe> I'm just not sure what to do there
[09/06 10:08] <06Amit_ZOS> I think we can go ahead and talk it over this week.. I will get her up to speed when needed
[09/06 10:09] <02charlie> can i sit in on that?
[09/06 10:09] <06Amit_ZOS> Do you want me to book a vroom debbie?
[09/06 10:09] <dsk_hbe> ok, that'd be great if you can do that for her!  Sure Charlie!
[09/06 10:09] <02charlie> get your engines running! vroom, vroom! :)
[09/06 10:10] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/06 10:10] <dsk_hbe> sure, Amit... lets start with an hour anytime that fits in all of our calendars.  
[09/06 10:10] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, woudl you rather do it Thursday so you can be onsite with Amit?
[09/06 10:11] <dsk_hbe> if you are coming on site that is.
[09/06 10:11] <02charlie> i think im coming onsite tomorrow
[09/06 10:11] <dsk_hbe> why don't we do that then so if I say something that you can help Amit see easier hands on?
[09/06 10:11] <02charlie> that would be fine. i think jim is planning on talking at our team meeting today
[09/06 10:12] <02charlie> sure
[09/06 10:12] <dsk_hbe> good point... enough meeting time for one day today ;-)
[09/06 10:12] <02charlie> lol
[09/06 10:12] <02charlie> i know you love meetings, debbie, admit it! :D
[09/06 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> So thursday?
[09/06 10:13] <02charlie> yes
[09/06 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> what time?
[09/06 10:13] <02charlie> btw, debbie, just throw me into xm whenever you're ready to leave
[09/06 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> your calendars are not loading in mine
[09/06 10:14] <dsk_hbe> I'm good with whatever fits in my calendar, Amit, so check there for an open space... if you want, make it 2 hours just in case... though I'm sure Charlie will be busy whiel on cacmpus
[09/06 10:14] <dsk_hbe> whaaaaat???  I'll cehck permissions, sec
[09/06 10:15] <dsk_hbe> it says you have the same permissions as Charlie...c an you load it Charlie?
[09/06 10:15] <02charlie> lmc, i went to outhouse 2016, and i tried sharing with you all and it went into error
[09/06 10:16] <02charlie> yeah, i was able to open yours
[09/06 10:17] <06Amit_ZOS> loaded now
[09/06 10:17] <06Amit_ZOS> so coincidently, the time i schedule works i suppose?
[09/06 10:18] <dsk_hbe> works for me!
[09/06 10:19] <06Amit_ZOS> k, lemme see if i can extend it to two hrs
[09/06 10:21] <dsk_hbe> I warn you... I am not going to prepare anythign fancy, so hopefully it won't be terribly confusing!
[09/06 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> I will try my best to keep up!
[09/06 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> Dont we also need to do 'how to check tomcat logs'?
[09/06 10:22] <dsk_hbe> I haven't gone through my stats jobs yet to see for myself but Wayne just mentioned that that Arachnys ID had over 70,000 CPU seconds yesterday, Amit... such a pig!!
[09/06 10:22] <dsk_hbe> yeah I have a list here, but lets start with SORs and see how far we get
[09/06 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. bg was swamped with that guy
[09/06 10:23] <dsk_hbe> sounds like Jim got that BG/FG split in just in time!
[09/06 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> Yeah!
[09/06 10:23] <dsk_hbe> ok, back to catching up on my jobs... I tend to be more lax abotu it cause I know Amit is looking... ahhhhh.... good job Amit!
[09/06 10:24] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. usually the first thing in the morning Debbie! :)
[09/06 10:24] <dsk_hbe> excellent!!!
[09/06 10:24] <dsk_hbe> you and Wayne beat me ;-)
[09/06 10:25] <06Amit_ZOS> 20, 50 and 60 is what i check religiously though
[09/06 10:26] <dsk_hbe> those are certainly teh ones that have the most interesting info
[09/06 10:26] <dsk_hbe> 10 is more there for if we have something odd I go check there
[09/06 10:26] <dsk_hbe> 30 has the FAULT report, but it is usually boring ;-)
[09/06 10:26] <dsk_hbe> 40 is hardly ever exciting ;-)
[09/06 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/06 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> ;-)
[09/06 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> recently i started looking at ERJCSOR too
[09/06 10:28] <dsk_hbe> now that is chock full of interesting info ;-)  I don't look much past the WORST report, looking for Classic people to yell at, but Wayne devours that info
[09/06 10:28] <06Amit_ZOS> mostly cz once, when i crosschecked an id with him regarding high dart counts, he said it was ok due to low search volume that day.. since then im looking there to see what 'low search volume' actually looks like
[09/06 10:29] <dsk_hbe> you will learn a lot talking to Wayne... I know I do!
[09/06 10:30] <dsk_hbe> as far as those IDs in DARTs, though, I'm hoping to show you how most often they are victim... unless you are Arachnys ;-)  But it is a wall time number so most often it is people being delayed due to higher priority work.
[09/06 10:30] <dsk_hbe> higher priority work eating CPU especially
[09/06 10:32] <06Amit_ZOS> got it
[09/06 10:33] <06Amit_ZOS> if i schedule a pto in people hub right now, will i be able to change it later in case i decide to work one of those days??
[09/06 10:34] <dsk_hbe> I am sure you can, yeah
[09/06 10:34] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/06 10:34] <dsk_hbe> not sure I have ever done it, but I think I recall seeign an option 
[09/06 10:35] <dsk_hbe> LOL, I just got to today's 50 job... Arachnys owns that BG DART list... not sure I have ever seen that before!
[09/06 10:35] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. yeah
[09/06 10:37] <dsk_hbe> are either of you guys excel experts?
[09/06 10:38] <02charlie> ive done some what do you need?
[09/06 10:38] <02charlie> i wouldnt ever call me an expert
[09/06 10:38] <02charlie> :)
[09/06 10:38] <dsk_hbe> I added a header to my excel report and it changed how it displays, breaking the display into two pages and I hate this... I can't seem to figure out how to change it back so it doesn't display this way
[09/06 10:39] <dsk_hbe> my expert is in Houston or I'd ask him ;-)
[09/06 10:39] <02charlie> lol
[09/06 10:39] <02charlie> i think there's a print option that allows you to scale the print
[09/06 10:40] <02charlie> if you go to the print option, the last option in the middle left of the screen is scaling
[09/06 10:40] <dsk_hbe> I played with a print setting, but it's not so much how it 'prints' on paper that is bugging me
[09/06 10:41] <02charlie> one of the option is fit all columns onto one page
[09/06 10:41] <dsk_hbe> maybe I need the print option you mean... where is that at?
[09/06 10:41] <dsk_hbe> oic, I think, sec
[09/06 10:41] <02charlie> you can also pick fit all rows on one page
[09/06 10:41] <02charlie> or fit all on one page
[09/06 10:42] <02charlie> or finally, no scaling, the default
[09/06 10:42] <dsk_hbe> ok, that's better, thanks!  I still want to get rid of this header stuff but this is at least not making me as mad anymore ;-)
[09/06 10:43] <02charlie> good
[09/06 10:45] <02charlie> depends on what you want to do. do you not want the header? you you want the header repositioned?
[09/06 10:45] <02charlie> do you=you you
[09/06 10:46] <dsk_hbe> I think I'll leave it as is... it's not that I hate the header itself, it's the way it now has this ruler thing on the top and sides.
[09/06 10:47] <02charlie> meeting over heading out
[09/06 10:53] * charlie has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 363 seconds)
[09/06 10:54] <dsk_hbe> brb
[09/06 11:00] <dsk_hbe> back
[09/06 11:17] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[09/06 11:17] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Jim!
[09/06 11:17] <dsk_hbe> hiya, Jim
[09/06 11:21] <JimE_zOS> even tho I've told OPS every freakin' single night that the new bridge processs has run that the "LEXIS is down on this system" message will NOT be issued, I still get a page from Sherry 
[09/06 11:21] <JimE_zOS> Larry had the question. 
[09/06 11:21] <JimE_zOS> and when I pointed out that this has been discussed (which Sherry absolutely knew), Larry claims he wasn't in last night. 
[09/06 11:22] <dsk_hbe> are they not sharing or is it the same people every night?  either way... :-(
[09/06 11:22] <JimE_zOS> so they can't be trusted to share when they are all sitting in the same room. 
[09/06 11:22] <dsk_hbe> oh well poo on them :-(
[09/06 11:22] <JimE_zOS> I think that is a poo jinx. :-)
[09/06 11:22] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[09/06 11:24] <JimE_zOS> I'd like to have a team mtg this afternoon. 
[09/06 11:24] <dsk_hbe> cool by me!
[09/06 11:24] <JimE_zOS> it won't be rise to the level of turnover
[09/06 11:24] <JimE_zOS> nor do I want anybody to think that this is the only time we will talk about the new bridging process. 
[09/06 11:25] <JimE_zOS> but I hope to instill some familiarity
[09/06 11:26] * charlie has joined #theRock
[09/06 11:33] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I sent a fresh meeting notice for this afternoon's meeting. 
[09/06 11:34] <JimE_zOS> I kept the room, however, so if Amit would like to listen in 11CR155, he sure can. 
[09/06 11:34] <02charlie> yep. saw you were up at bridge time again
[09/06 11:34] <JimE_zOS> I'm home today,
[09/06 11:34] <JimE_zOS> I wanted to watch bridge CRIT (which worked perfectly, BTW) 
[09/06 11:34] <dsk_hbe> great!!
[09/06 11:34] <JimE_zOS> but I'd have been up regardless due to an OPS page 
[09/06 11:34] <dsk_hbe> miracles, I tell you ;-)
[09/06 11:35] <02charlie> i didnt get paged, did they just page you directly?
[09/06 11:35] <02charlie> and was that because of the messages?
[09/06 11:37] <06Amit_ZOS> 11CR155 just to myself.. nice! ;-)
[09/06 11:40] <JimE_zOS> you could put each foot on a different chair :-)
[09/06 11:41] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Charlie, yes, paged directly. 
[09/06 11:41] <JimE_zOS> didn't even create a ticket. 
[09/06 11:41] <JimE_zOS> and yes, motivated by the message. 
[09/06 11:48] <06Amit_ZOS> lemme get food before the meeting
[09/06 11:48] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[09/06 12:08] <02charlie> interesting line in the config file: QLRB_HCSADDR_PFD_1="SYSZ:PFDMNGR:RR004012"; export QLRB_HCSADDR_PFD_1
[09/06 12:09] <02charlie> patent finder i would guess
[09/06 12:09] <02charlie> RR must be some PFD server?
[09/06 12:10] <dsk_hbe> for pscz1871/2?  I think Anita set up a PFD set up for them (because we never did and no one cared as much as her ;-) for PRG testing
[09/06 12:10] <dsk_hbe> but if that is not in the qlrb env dataset *we* own, a future change will hose them.
[09/06 12:10] <02charlie> that's actualy psc1870
[09/06 12:10] <dsk_hbe> oh well, I do't care ;-)
[09/06 12:11] <02charlie> lol
[09/06 12:12] <dsk_hbe> apparently we don't have a qlrb.env member for the pscz guys either
[09/06 12:14] <dsk_hbe> oh well... we are surviving just fine I guess
[09/06 12:14] <02charlie> there is one if you append .ta.prod
[09/06 12:14] <02charlie> but no pfd entry in 1871
[09/06 12:14] <dsk_hbe> I'm talking in the nz00 datasets
[09/06 12:14] <dsk_hbe> which is where I'd expect FABC to be
[09/06 12:14] <02charlie> ah, i was looking on the box itself, folloing jiC's instructions
[09/06 12:15] <dsk_hbe> yeah, nope, we maintain the configs via pz00.ss.config and nz00.ss.config on our side.
[09/06 12:15] <dsk_hbe> if they ever edit something over there, they may some day be hosed ;-)
[09/06 12:16] <02charlie> yeah
[09/06 12:18] <dsk_hbe> it is sad that I only even recognize 3 names in that email from Riehl
[09/06 12:30] <dsk_hbe> pool guy just announced they were on their way to do some repairs I reported weeks ago... he thinks he will be here before our meeting starts, but if I am a little late to arrive to it, blame our lame pool people

[09/06 14:58] <Amit_away> That was an awesome presentation Sir James!
[09/06 14:58] * Amit_ZOS has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 362 seconds)
[09/06 14:58] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/06 15:05] <JimE_zOS> and, FWIW, I've looked and the logic that stopped the C1 copies will be fine in production. 
[09/06 15:05] <JimE_zOS> production actually has two sets of F-Cards, C1 doesn't.
[09/06 15:06] <JimE_zOS> so....same code base 
[09/06 15:06] <06Amit_zOS> Jim, Bridge 2.0 is active right now right?
[09/06 15:07] <dsk_hbe> in case he's gone... yep :-)  for LSRs
[09/06 15:07] <dsk_hbe> you can go look at the diary.daily and see the copies bouncinf after 10pm
[09/06 15:09] <06Amit_zOS> actually i just found that when i did mj.srdiary all today, it started of with data from 9:20ish am today
[09/06 15:09] <JimE_zOS> not gone, just not watching.  I was checking my dependency changes in OPC to make sure they are in the current plan for tonight. 
[09/06 15:10] <JimE_zOS> and, what she said.  :-)
[09/06 15:10] <dsk_hbe> well if teh earlier monitors were reused that may be all you get... you aren't see the copies going through start-up at 9:20 are you?
[09/06 15:11] <06Amit_zOS> no.. only the fresh monitors being reused.. that implies heavy use of monitors in the early hours right?
[09/06 15:11] <06Amit_zOS> i had not observed how often this happens
[09/06 15:11] <dsk_hbe> it's not all that surprising to go through a lot of monitors in a day
[09/06 15:11] <dsk_hbe> sec
[09/06 15:12] <02charlie> you can find the list of monitors created for today
[09/06 15:12] <dsk_hbe> part of what I was gonna show you tomorrow...
[09/06 15:12] <06Amit_zOS> Ah..
[09/06 15:12] <06Amit_zOS> i will hold off till then
[09/06 15:13] <02charlie> STAGE*.PE00.LPAED.PROD.MON.D17249.CPY*.L*
[09/06 15:13] <06Amit_zOS> ok.. another q..
[09/06 15:14] <02charlie> that would be for today #249 (julia day)
[09/06 15:14] <06Amit_zOS> now that we have more bg copies, do we or have we already changed the jnorm score criteria to classify a background and foreground search?
[09/06 15:14] <02charlie> there's 398 of them out there
[09/06 15:14] <02charlie> 166 are SR monitirs
[09/06 15:14] <dsk_hbe> I don't think there are any plans to change that in the offing, Amit.  I'm sure Wayne is analyzing the stats and will let us know if he thinks we need a change
[09/06 15:14] <dsk_hbe> I think it's unlikely
[09/06 15:15] <02charlie> the rest are FD
[09/06 15:15] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[09/06 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Charlie!
[09/06 15:16] <06Amit_zOS> saw them

[09/06 15:54] <dsk_hbe> yeah via that beyond slick process... I swear that is some slick stuff!!!!
[09/06 15:54] <02charlie> oops wrong copy
[09/06 15:55] <02charlie> but yeah, very slick
[09/06 15:55] <dsk_hbe> working as designed ;-)
[09/06 15:55] <02charlie> lol
[09/06 15:57] <02charlie> and it looks like around 0830 is when you run bridge SOD
[09/06 15:58] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I don't think that's new though
[09/06 15:58] <dsk_hbe> different time on Sunday... what did he say? 3pm?
[09/06 15:58] <02charlie> that sounds right
[09/06 15:59] <dsk_hbe> and I'll just keep answering for Jim as long as he doesn't yell at me ;-)
[09/06 15:59] <02charlie> my wife got the apartment, she's starting to move the light stuff in. cox will call her to give her the deal they give to that complex, so she's waiting on a can from them

[09/06 16:00] <dsk_hbe> :)
[09/06 16:01] <JimE_zOS> I take it as a small win that the stylesheet people don't know this change took place. 
[09/06 16:01] <dsk_hbe> yeah, adds to the slickness ;-)

[09/06 16:05] <JimE_zOS> can't go by past runs. 
[09/06 16:05] <JimE_zOS> I've done all sorts of crazy things to these. 
[09/06 16:05] <02charlie> :)
[09/06 16:05] <JimE_zOS> both to test and to install new code. 
[09/06 16:05] <JimE_zOS> so past is not prologue in this case. 
[09/06 16:07] <JimE_zOS> yeah, ignore those, Charlie 
[09/06 16:07] <JimE_zOS> those are left over time references. 
[09/06 16:07] <02charlie> ah, ok
[09/06 16:07] <JimE_zOS> but you'll notice that the operation is NOT marked as TIME DEPENDENT
[09/06 16:08] <JimE_zOS> so, the time you find there is meaningless. 
[09/06 16:08] <JimE_zOS> it is NOT meaningless for teh START operation, however. 
[09/06 16:08] <JimE_zOS> which arrives when the application arrives (22:00) 
[09/06 16:08] <JimE_zOS> and that IS marked time dependent. 
[09/06 16:08] <JimE_zOS> so sloppy, but harmless. 
[09/06 16:09] <02charlie> ah i see: Time depend: Yes
[09/06 16:09] <02charlie> as opposed to step 10: Time depend: No
[09/06 16:09] <02charlie> gotch
[09/06 16:09] <02charlie> a
[09/06 16:09] <02charlie> :)
[09/06 16:14] <JimE_zOS> slop removed. 
[09/06 16:15] <JimE_zOS> I probably started with teh old bridge SR application as the basis for my new application. 
[09/06 16:27] <dsk_hbe> I shodul probably head out.  Talk to you all tomorrow!

[09/06 21:42] <JimE_zOS> and because Martha came earlier than I expected, I didnt get a chance to watch. 
[09/06 21:42] <JimE_zOS> very sorry 
[09/06 21:46] <06Amit_zOS> Your good Jim! ;-)
[09/06 22:26] <Charlie_merely_lurking> not a problem, i figured it out and took care of it

[09/07 09:00] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[09/07 09:09] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, the bridge to prod SR worked as designed (and w/out intervention) last night. 
[09/07 09:10] <JimE_zOS> the bridge to prod start (02:00) started a little later than it has (02:10) but only because I have the dependencies correctly configured (so we have to wait for bridge LFD to end) 
[09/07 09:10] <JimE_zOS> and because it manipulates fewer copies (minus the x2, x3, x7 and x8 CRE copies), it completes more quickly

[09/07 09:41] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Debbie. 
[09/07 09:41] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, Randy Shumate is investigating an aux. storage shortage on SYSD. 
[09/07 09:41] <JimE_zOS> he asked me to bounce the C1 dataspaces on SYSD.  
[09/07 09:41] <JimE_zOS> which I've done 
[09/07 09:42] <dsk_hbe> cool
[09/07 09:42] <JimE_zOS> that relieved the issue, but he is still looking. 
[09/07 09:43] <JimE_zOS> and I puttered around with LVT STCKs last night enough to understand what I have to do to eliminate the NEWEOJ modify command from the new process. 
[09/07 09:43] <JimE_zOS> I'll work on code today 
[09/07 09:43] <dsk_hbe> spiffy... how's the birthday girl?  My birthday girl's day is today
[09/07 09:44] * Amit_away has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 361 seconds)
[09/07 09:44] <JimE_zOS> HB to Hannah! 
[09/07 09:44] <dsk_hbe> I will pass it along :-)
[09/07 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> Happy B'day to Hannah! :)
[09/07 09:45] <dsk_hbe> how is it possible our babies are this old, Jim?  I still remember Katie, I think it was, saying 'lexis vector table' to me over the phone :-)
[09/07 09:45] <JimE_zOS> KRE has come a long way from that girl in pig tails you saw in the Countryside news letter. 
[09/07 09:45] <dsk_hbe> I bet she has!!
[09/07 09:46] <JimE_zOS> I'm gonna count that as a jinx 
[09/07 09:46] <dsk_hbe> I think you must ;-)
[09/07 09:46] <JimE_zOS> U were in Az at teh time...so I think that was ERE. 
[09/07 09:46] <dsk_hbe> I don't know why I always get that wrong!
[09/07 09:47] <dsk_hbe> dsn
[09/07 09:47] <dsk_hbe> oops
[09/07 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> happy B'day to KRE too!??
[09/07 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> they share b'days?
[09/07 09:48] <JimE_zOS> almost. 
[09/07 09:48] <JimE_zOS> but we didn't know each other at the time. 
[09/07 09:48] <JimE_zOS> that came later. 
[09/07 09:48] * charlie has joined #theRock
[09/07 09:48] <JimE_zOS> howdy, Charlie. 
[09/07 09:48] <06Amit_ZOS> Morning Charlie!
[09/07 09:49] <JimE_zOS> unfortunately, not while Debbie was still in town. 
[09/07 09:49] <02charlie> hi jim & amit
[09/07 09:49] <JimE_zOS> I joined the group after she had already started her road show. 
[09/07 09:49] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I really missed out on knowing Jim in person... he manages to amuse me from afar though ;-)
[09/07 09:49] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah....Debbie on tour! 
[09/07 09:50] <JimE_zOS> can I buy a t-shirt in the lobby?  :-)
[09/07 09:50] <02charlie> lol
[09/07 09:50] <02charlie> morning debbie
[09/07 09:50] <JimE_zOS> I need that phone app that looks like a lighter 
[09/07 09:50] <02charlie> lol
[09/07 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/07 09:50] <dsk_hbe> LOL... they're all boring... Phoenix (ok, maybe not bad), but Edmond, Oklahmoa... pass!; and McKinney (now The Colony) Texas... not so much
[09/07 09:51] <06Amit_ZOS> folks are feeling nostalgic today morning!
[09/07 09:52] <dsk_hbe> hey Jim, I'm curious why Bobbie was looking at CL9... isn't that the side that they use for release checkout?  Maybe she just runs both always.
[09/07 09:52] <dsk_hbe> or maybe they are working on a release, I guess, seems like that has been a while
[09/07 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie, where can i see the bg cpu usage for an id or id's? 
[09/07 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> RE: ZGMBZZ
[09/07 09:54] <dsk_hbe> well, in e88dsk60, I report all day numbers for the top CPU users and the top FG CPU users.  I don't bother reporting the same for top BG, but if the ID you are looking for is in both lists, you can subtract one fromt eh other.
[09/07 09:55] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. i know about the fg users
[09/07 09:55] <02charlie> i see scott haas has moved to where george was
[09/07 09:55] <02charlie> and i think doug p moved also?
[09/07 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> and i got your point
[09/07 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/07 09:56] <dsk_hbe> if that isn't the case, we can run a job to report it.  I can tell you the job I use now or we can talk abotu it at our meeting.  I was gonna show it there.  But since you know easytrieve, maybe you'd like to poke around and figure it out on your own. - gg.cellsord on RoscoeW... stolen from Bob Cella years ago :-)
[09/07 09:57] <JimE_zOS> FABC Cl09 has connectivity for some weird metadata testing, Debbie. 
[09/07 09:57] <JimE_zOS> I forget what it is...lexis.com related, I think 
[09/07 09:57] <dsk_hbe> I was thinking it was releases that she used it for... who knows though!
[09/07 09:58] <JimE_zOS> did George move or is he OOO? 
[09/07 10:01] <JimE_zOS> need to bounce mIRC.

[09/07 10:05] <JimE_zOS> I think we need to get Wayne a "Mr. Goodwrench" shirt. 
[09/07 10:06] <dsk_hbe> that's a great idea!  :-)
[09/07 10:06] <02charlie> :)
[09/07 10:06] <02charlie> yeah, that's a great fix
[09/07 10:13] <JimE_zOS> I'm about to tune out to code.  Before I do, any update on Triveni? 
[09/07 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> she texted me.. she i recovering well
[09/07 10:14] <JimE_zOS> good...glad to hear it. 
[09/07 10:14] <dsk_hbe> do you know, Amit, if they found nothing of concern on her neck MRI?
[09/07 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> i think she will stay there untill the weekend
[09/07 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> they said that it will heal itself with the neck support in place
[09/07 10:15] <dsk_hbe> thanks... was hoping it was just a precaution, but this is better than it coudl be
[09/07 10:15] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah.. hopefully she is allowed to fly in here sometime next week
[09/07 10:16] <06Amit_ZOS> she is going to start with physio therapy
[09/07 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> dang my firefox tabs keep crashing!
[09/07 10:23] <JimE_zOS> glad to hear that she is on the mend. 
[09/07 10:27] <JimE_zOS> Charlie, I need to build that F-Card rename change request....what request of Wayne's did you say you wanted to include?  the MFR limit bump?? 
[09/07 10:28] <02charlie> yes
[09/07 10:28] <JimE_zOS> k 
[09/07 10:28] <02charlie> thx
[09/07 10:31] <dsk_hbe> did he say he was ready for that?  I forget already!
[09/07 10:31] <02charlie> yeah, i think he did
[09/07 10:31] <dsk_hbe> kthx... ya take a couple days off work and brain cells evaporate ;-)
[09/07 10:31] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah thats what i was wondering
[09/07 10:31] <02charlie> let me find his note
[09/07 10:32] <06Amit_ZOS> im taking a week off next to next week.. i hope I remember what a mainframe is!
[09/07 10:32] <dsk_hbe> ok, also though someone was concerned abotu making the jmenu change close to that... is that gonna happen too?
[09/07 10:32] <dsk_hbe> the struggle is real, Amit ;-)
[09/07 10:33] <02charlie> sent his note
[09/07 10:34] <dsk_hbe> ah thanks... he only copied you so my brain cells are forgiven
[09/07 10:34] <02charlie> ah
[09/07 10:34] <dsk_hbe> don't forget the jmenu piece
[09/07 10:34] <02charlie> didnt notice, i assumed he had put us all on it
[09/07 10:37] <06Amit_ZOS> whats the jmenu piece?
[09/07 10:37] <dsk_hbe> I'll say it a 3rd time just to be annoying... the jmenu change is likely most important since the larger number of searches use jnorm for normalization rather than mainframe norm
[09/07 10:37] <dsk_hbe> it holds a similar parm in chasm, Amit.
[09/07 10:39] <06Amit_ZOS> I see
[09/07 10:39] <dsk_hbe> oh and feel free to take ownership of that STASK, Charlie!
[09/07 10:40] <02charlie> STASK01056991 is the MRF limit one right?
[09/07 10:40] <dsk_hbe> right
[09/07 10:40] <JimE_zOS> I suppose I should avoid pointing out that an MFR bump is really needed because LA sucks, right? 
[09/07 10:40] <02charlie> and STASK01061449 is for the jmenu change?
[09/07 10:40] <dsk_hbe> we're all friends here, Jim ;-)  Only here ;-)
[09/07 10:41] <dsk_hbe> no, 1056991 is for both fcards and jmenu
[09/07 10:41] <dsk_hbe> that other one is only PFD
[09/07 10:42] <dsk_hbe> Jim took it because it has to happen during his next oncall
[09/07 10:42] <dsk_hbe> unrelated
[09/07 10:42] <02charlie> ah ok
[09/07 10:42] <02charlie> and i see both requests are in the one stask
[09/07 10:42] <02charlie> gotcha
[09/07 10:42] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, Amit, this is the jmenu parm - MAX_MFR_LIMIT="10000"
[09/07 10:43] <02charlie> so do i need to make a separate change request for the jmenu change? (Im guessing the asnwer is yes)
[09/07 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. i remember 
[09/07 10:43] <dsk_hbe> who knows... hate that process... but you will need to bounce it in 
[09/07 10:45] <dsk_hbe> and I forget who was concerned, but the worry was if they didn't go together and a user somehoe ran a search that went through a mainframe norm-using application and also one through a JNorm using application, they'd get different results... so they were concerned that we needed to do both close together.
[09/07 10:45] <dsk_hbe> I have to wonder if any such user exists, but I don't know what all apps still use non-sv3 searching
[09/07 10:46] <dsk_hbe> batch search for sure, but they are in their own stupid world ;-)
[09/07 10:48] <02charlie> well that means the jmenu change will have to go it at 0200
[09/07 10:48] <02charlie> i'll go talk to wayne
[09/07 10:49] <dsk_hbe> I bet you could do it tonight and no onewoudl notice... normal hours and all
[09/07 10:49] <dsk_hbe> normal = non-sleep hours ;-)
[09/07 10:49] <02charlie> yeah, but i'll probably need a change request
[09/07 10:49] <dsk_hbe> Hannah says thanksfor the birthday wishes :-)

[09/07 12:04] <02charlie> k, thx
[09/07 12:04] <06Amit_ZOS> when? i mmissed everything since 10:49!
[09/07 12:04] <02charlie> what's the chg number?
[09/07 12:04] <dsk_hbe> <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I'm considering taking tomorrow off as a recoup day.
[09/07 12:04] <02charlie> that's why i dont use the wired connection here
[09/07 12:05] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome.. don't mow the lawn tomorrow though! ;-)
[09/07 12:06] <02charlie> oh, there's a standard change for classic chasm changes, nice
[09/07 12:06] <dsk_hbe> is that owned by middleware?  it may not let you pretend to own it if so
[09/07 12:06] <02charlie> oh, yeah
[09/07 12:07] <02charlie> looks like it might let e change that 
[09/07 12:07] <dsk_hbe> cool!!
[09/07 12:07] <02charlie> let me change it :)
[09/07 12:08] <dsk_hbe> be sure to thank JImC ;-)

[09/07 12:27] <dsk_hbe> certainly fine by me, Charlie
[09/07 12:45] <dsk_hbe> is this Triveni's cell? 937 270 5699

[09/07 12:57] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/07 13:01] <JimE_zOS> Charlie?  Have you tried filtering your blood with pure sodium?  :-)
[09/07 13:01] <JimE_zOS> heating some soup for lunch. 
[09/07 13:01] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/07 13:02] <JimE_zOS> our microwave broke this past weekend (as I was trying to heat some coffee in the middle of the night) 
[09/07 13:02] <JimE_zOS> so I have a new one on the kitchen table, but not yet installed yet. 
[09/07 13:02] <JimE_zOS> did you know you can heat soup on the stove?? :-)
[09/07 13:02] <JimE_zOS> who'd have thought. 
[09/07 13:02] <dsk_hbe> LOL!!!!!!!!!!
[09/07 13:03] <JimE_zOS> I took the old one down last night in preparation of installation tonight. 
[09/07 13:03] <JimE_zOS> I need a microwave. 
[09/07 13:04] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if Amit ever knew a time when they didn't exist... dark days...
[09/07 13:04] <JimE_zOS> sure...back when people used green moss as a bandaid.  
[09/07 13:05] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/07 13:05] <JimE_zOS> I don't understand it, but my soup is getting hot.  Wow. 
[09/07 13:05] <dsk_hbe> you crack me up!
[09/07 13:08] <02charlie> lol @ filtering and stove
[09/07 13:09] <02charlie> gordon just cornered me and asked how strong is the fg/bg preferences of the copies
[09/07 13:09] <dsk_hbe> strong??
[09/07 13:09] <02charlie> if a fg/bg copy is idle, when will it take up bf/fg work?
[09/07 13:10] <dsk_hbe> I still don't think I understand hsi question... like if all FG was down, will BG take the load... yes, definitely.
[09/07 13:11] <dsk_hbe> and vice versa of course... fabc has no defined BGs so handles all load
[09/07 13:12] <02charlie> unless all the bg copies are down, would a fg copy take any bg work?
[09/07 13:12] <dsk_hbe> see above, yes, definitely
[09/07 13:12] <02charlie> and vice versa
[09/07 13:13] <02charlie> let me ask it this way: if all the bg copies were up, would a fg copy ever take bg work?
[09/07 13:13] <JimE_zOS> no
[09/07 13:14] <JimE_zOS> the OLS will make every attempt to put the work where it should be run. 
[09/07 13:14] <JimE_zOS> that said, the prime directive is to fail no transaction. 
[09/07 13:14] <JimE_zOS> so, when the desired copy type isn't available, we'll dispatch the work where we have to get it run. 
[09/07 13:14] <JimE_zOS> but that is at teh end of the code path. 
[09/07 13:15] <02charlie> ok, i think i understand that
[09/07 13:17] <02charlie> and in pull mode, the fg copies will only pull fg work and the bg copies will only pull bg work
[09/07 13:17] <dsk_hbe> yep, two different buckets in the sysplex
[09/07 13:17] <02charlie> so only in push mode could you ever get to a situation where a fg copy gets some bg work?
[09/07 13:17] <JimE_zOS> depends on which version of PULL we are using. 
[09/07 13:17] <JimE_zOS> you described original PULL 
[09/07 13:17] <dsk_hbe> yep
[09/07 13:18] <02charlie> oh, that's right, we now have multiple flavors
[09/07 13:18] <02charlie> forgot that
[09/07 13:18] <JimE_zOS> but we also have PULL only FG and PULL only BG 
[09/07 13:18] <dsk_hbe> that yep wasn't yo your question Charlie... I think you still aren't gettign what we were saying maybe
[09/07 13:18] <JimE_zOS> so it is complicated. 
[09/07 13:21] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/07 13:27] <06Amit_zOS> And I do very much know and cherish of a time when microwaves were not around in my house..
[09/07 13:27] <dsk_hbe> :-) My kids never knew such a time :-)
[09/07 13:28] <06Amit_zOS> actually i dont think ther was a microwave in my native place (Mom's hous) even when i arrived here for my masters two years ago
[09/07 13:28] <06Amit_zOS> furthermore in fact, they even had the old stove made of stone and used wood as fuel to cook stuff!
[09/07 13:29] <JimE_zOS> we've had the old microwave since we moved into this house.  When ERE was only 6 months old.  She is now 23.   In fact, the last time Debbie was here, same microwave.  I got my money's worth on that purchase. 
[09/07 13:29] <dsk_hbe> oh man... so you likely learned to really cook!
[09/07 13:29] <dsk_hbe> that's pretty darned good, Jim!  
[09/07 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> I made tofu fried rice for lunch in fact!
[09/07 13:29] <06Amit_zOS> :-P
[09/07 13:29] <dsk_hbe> sounds yummy!
[09/07 13:29] <02charlie> you wont be happy with your new one. they don't make them like that anymore, btw
[09/07 13:30] <JimE_zOS> when it was out paced by an Easy-Bake Oven, it had to go. 
[09/07 13:30] <02charlie> lol
[09/07 13:30] <06Amit_zOS> i still remember wiggling a fan at the burning wood to keep it burning hot!
[09/07 13:30] <JimE_zOS> oh, the old one was only a 750 W.  I hope to burn my mouth many times with teh new one. 
[09/07 13:30] <JimE_zOS> k..Amit wins. :-)
[09/07 13:31] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[09/07 13:31] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/07 13:31] <dsk_hbe> my first home only had an outhouse... that's the best I can do to join teh 'I struggled' discussion ;-)
[09/07 13:35] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I've got nothing better than that. 
[09/07 13:36] <dsk_hbe> ;)
[09/07 13:37] <JimE_zOS> we certainly weren't rich, but we lived comfortably.  So we didn't have struggles like that.  Most of our friends had more money (and lived like it) so that was always weird.  Looking back, we didn't really lack for any of hte essentials. 
[09/07 13:40] <06Amit_zOS> oh, and did you know, we had separated restrooms which were constructed about 100 feet from the main house.. and because i grew up in cities, i was not used to walking barefoot.. and when i went to my native place, i sometimes had to run without footware to the restrooms!! :-{
[09/07 13:40] <JimE_zOS> an entirely different view point, Amit. 
[09/07 13:41] <JimE_zOS> and U are probably better for it. 
[09/07 13:41] <06Amit_zOS> Oh i most certainly am
[09/07 13:41] <06Amit_zOS> i feel i have seen the best of both worlds!
[09/07 13:43] <06Amit_zOS> The only nightmares i had was of spiders... big, giant spiders the size of Jims palms!
[09/07 13:43] <dsk_hbe> sounds like it!
[09/07 13:43] <dsk_hbe> oh man... never going to India, ever...
[09/07 13:43] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[09/07 13:46] <JimE_zOS> this isn't the time to claim that I have little girl hands, is it? :-)
[09/07 13:46] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/07 13:47] <dsk_hbe> hmmm.. Eric hasn't cancelled staffer yet, has he?
[09/07 13:47] <06Amit_zOS> lots of good stories there..i can go on and on... timed power outtages (almost like OPC scheduled).. radio programs.. first cable tv..making cricket bats out of cocunut tree leaves bark. etc etc
[09/07 13:47] <06Amit_zOS> no Jim, quite the opposite! you have big hands!
[09/07 13:48] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[09/07 13:48] <06Amit_zOS> Man.. now Im nostalgic!
[09/07 13:51] <dsk_hbe> it's fun to talk abotu old times, but I sure woudl never want to go back to those days.
[09/07 13:52] <06Amit_zOS> just out of curiosity, how did you use to break coconuts?? (green shelled ones)
[09/07 13:52] <dsk_hbe> I have never in my life done that... I also hate the taste of coconut ;-)
[09/07 13:52] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[09/07 13:52] <06Amit_zOS> that used to be a work out for me!
[09/07 13:53] <dsk_hbe> I bet!
[09/07 13:57] <06Amit_zOS> https://youtu.be/sP2BSkBZ9KI
[09/07 13:57] <JimE_zOS> interesting that Ed has resolved the TP not working ticket with a "working as designed" while webI still shows TP RED. 
[09/07 13:58] <dsk_hbe> well TP does have a history of sucking... mayeb that's what he meant by 'as designed' ;-)
[09/07 13:58] <JimE_zOS> perhaps. 
[09/07 13:58] <JimE_zOS> and no arguement that the implementation does leave alot to be desired. 
[09/07 13:59] <JimE_zOS> I guess I'd have hoped that when the issue was resolved, webI would agree 
[09/07 13:59] <JimE_zOS> maybe it isn't possilble to make webI see reason. 
[09/07 14:00] <dsk_hbe> who knows... you were likely more correct in suspecting Ed did nothing
[09/07 14:07] <dsk_hbe> just nopticed your youtube link, Amit... that looks mighty dangerous!
[09/07 14:38] <02charlie> ok, so for the JMenu chasm change, all i have to do is use the chasmtui to change the variable in the resourceClass to the right value, and then bounce all the Jmenu copies, correct?
[09/07 14:39] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[09/07 14:41] <02charlie> sorry really need more caffeine

[09/07 15:12] <06Amit_ZOS> back
[09/07 15:16] <02charlie> and am i also correct debbie that once i make the change to that resourcseClass, i don't have to push it to all the USS images, i just have to bounce the copies?
[09/07 15:16] <dsk_hbe> got an email saying they processed my flower order so I'm hoping that means it actually gets delivered today.  In case she mentions it, I shodul tell you I included the comment 'We miss your questions!' on the card ;-)  I also included a plush doggie cause flowers die ;-)
[09/07 15:16] <dsk_hbe> correct, Charlie
[09/07 15:16] <02charlie> good. can i send you money?
[09/07 15:16] <dsk_hbe> I always am neurotic and make sure it gets picked up in every log when I bounce the copies... kinda overkill
[09/07 15:17] <02charlie> well, yeah, watching the log is a given :)
[09/07 15:17] <dsk_hbe> no money needed.... just wanted to make srue she knew we were thinking baout her!
[09/07 15:17] <02charlie> sure
[09/07 15:21] <02charlie> and i think i dont have t0 direct the action to, eg, syscip either, since its a chasm resourceClass
[09/07 15:21] <dsk_hbe> I'm going to head out.  If Amit is here until 5, please just leave me in daytime, especially since you are headed for a dentist appt. in the morning, Charlie.  
[09/07 15:22] <02charlie> ok, thx debbie
[09/07 15:22] <dsk_hbe> I believe you are correct there Charlie, though I always feel better switching to an MVS image for some reason... again, likely overkill
[09/07 15:22] <06Amit_ZOS> i will be here
[09/07 15:22] <dsk_hbe> ok, thx!  Have a good evening.  Jim, I hope you are able to take that day off and can enjoy it or just sleep a lot :-)
[09/07 15:22] * dsk_hbe is now known as dsk_away
[09/07 15:23] <02charlie> yeah, i think i did that in the past, but when it seemed to propogate to all the USS images, i figured it wont matter
[09/07 15:23] <02charlie> bye debbie
[09/07 15:23] <02charlie> and jim, i too hope you're taking tomorrow off
[09/07 15:23] <dsk_away> yeah, neurotic am I abotu things ;-)

[09/07 16:55] <JimE_zOS> K, I think I have LVT NEWEOJ like routine ready 
[09/07 16:55] <JimE_zOS> will NOT use it tonight. 
[09/07 16:55] <JimE_zOS> needs more testing 
[09/07 16:55] <JimE_zOS> probably some quality time with C1 this weekend. 
[09/07 16:55] <02charlie> :)
[09/07 16:56] <JimE_zOS> bottom line, changing nothing in the bridge code base tonight at all 
[09/07 16:56] <02charlie> do you need me to make the f-card changes so that they're ready for saturday at 0200?
[09/07 16:56] <JimE_zOS> nah, I'll do that tomorrow, Charlie. 
[09/07 16:57] <JimE_zOS> or heck, later tonight even. 
[09/07 16:57] <02charlie> when you're taking the day off? ;)
[09/07 16:57] <JimE_zOS> my part will only take 5 minutes.  Not even. 
[09/07 16:57] <JimE_zOS> we'll see about the day off part 
[09/07 16:57] <JimE_zOS> anyway, got some things to do before MEE returns for the day 
[09/07 16:58] <02charlie> and i see that CHG0165866 is scheduled, but don't you need to assign it to L1 prod support?

[09/07 16:58] <02charlie> you might be screwed now that it's scheduled
[09/07 16:58] <02charlie> might need to get ops to change it
[09/07 16:59] <JimE_zOS> yeah....I'll work on that too. 
[09/07 16:59] <JimE_zOS> stupid tool

[09/08 09:30] <02charlie> morning debbie
[09/08 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> GOod morning ! :)
[09/08 09:38] <dsk_hbe> Hey Charlie, I'm not sure your email to Maica makes sense.  On UNIX release night they are coming through PROD TA, not FABC TA, right?  
[09/08 09:38] <02charlie> yeah
[09/08 09:38] <02charlie> no,,no
[09/08 09:39] <dsk_hbe> indecisove today? ;-)
[09/08 09:40] <02charlie> i thought they still used the pscz1871/2 connections for the release night testing until they gave it a go, then they dropped the fab ta connections altogether and went thru the (new) prod ta
[09/08 09:41] <dsk_hbe> since we never really were given an overview of that new release process, I won't swear to anything, but I thought they podded it.
[09/08 09:42] <dsk_hbe> via prod only, that is... but I know very little about their full process
[09/08 09:42] <dsk_hbe> I thought pscz1871/2 were out of the picture after they started using psc1870
[09/08 09:43] <dsk_hbe> JimC will either set you or me straight when he replies to that I am sure ;-)
[09/08 09:43] <dsk_hbe> Amit, Wayne just knew we were discussing that topic just yesterday! :-)
[09/08 09:43] <02charlie> :)

[09/08 11:30] <06Amit_zOS> looks like ZGMBZZ just overtook arachnys but just barely..;-)
[09/08 11:32] <dsk_hbe> I am looking forward to Vickie's changes and seeing how much that alters their consumption.  THey still don't have a firm date chosen for a release though
[09/08 11:32] <06Amit_zOS> bitmap changes for negative news?
[09/08 11:32] <dsk_hbe> and I was only fast because it was a short week and too much email catchup involved ;-)
[09/08 11:33] <06Amit_zOS> oh yes.. that email from wayne said that majority of his searches are nn right?
[09/08 11:33] <dsk_hbe> the email I sent you and Charlie yesterday where she is looking at including w/p and w/s into negative news processing
[09/08 11:33] <dsk_hbe> jinx!
[09/08 11:33] <06Amit_zOS> jinx
[09/08 11:33] <dsk_hbe> I win ;-)
[09/08 11:33] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[09/08 11:50] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[09/08 11:50] <06Amit_zOS> Hi Jim!
[09/08 11:50] <JimE_zOS> that was my first 8 hour sleep night since the start of my oncall week.
[09/08 11:51] <JimE_zOS> but my plan to take the day is a little goofed. 
[09/08 11:52] <JimE_zOS> so I'll tidy up some things here and at teh house. 
[09/08 11:52] <JimE_zOS> I installed the new microwave last night so the kitchen is a bit of a mess. 
[09/08 11:52] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim!
[09/08 11:55] <JimE_zOS> working on my J-Card change now. 
[09/08 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> brb.. some food
[09/08 12:13] <JimE_zOS> here's a OLS trivia question: What happens during start-up if a copy encounters a lowercase letter for the manual/automatic setting?  
[09/08 12:14] <02charlie> oh, nice :)
[09/08 12:14] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... I'm gonna guess he croaks?
[09/08 12:14] <02charlie> i'm guessing it ignore it?
[09/08 12:14] <02charlie> Manual as default maybe?
[09/08 12:14] <JimE_zOS> good quess, both wrong. 
[09/08 12:15] <dsk_hbe> I'm surprised fjedit didn't croak actually
[09/08 12:15] <02charlie> sheesh
[09/08 12:15] <JimE_zOS> the copy goes into a spin loop. 
[09/08 12:15] <02charlie> nice :)
[09/08 12:15] <dsk_hbe> oh my!
[09/08 12:15] <JimE_zOS> John Heck and I did exactly during a BCP test. 
[09/08 12:15] <JimE_zOS> he changed the J-Cards (cause at that point, we weren't testing a full config) 
[09/08 12:15] <JimE_zOS> and I gave teh copy a start and, well, it didn't 
[09/08 12:16] <JimE_zOS> that might have been pre-TCPIP.  
[09/08 12:16] <JimE_zOS> so perhaps that code is gone. 
[09/08 12:16] <JimE_zOS> but I keep in my mind that case matters. 
[09/08 12:17] <02charlie> yeah, i'll bet it does
[09/08 12:18] <JimE_zOS> I'll be done with my UPPERCASE "A" changes here in a sec. 
[09/08 12:19] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/08 12:24] <02charlie> i may take someone to the airport about 1500, 1530. I can take this with me
[09/08 12:24] <dsk_hbe> I shodul be around the house if I'm not still at my desk
[09/08 12:24] <dsk_hbe> I'll stay in XM 
[09/08 12:26] <02charlie> if youre ok with that. i can take xm and carry this with me
[09/08 12:30] <dsk_hbe> nope, I'm good... don't carry that thing any more than you have to!
[09/08 12:37] <JimE_zOS> why do I always get this picture in my head of Charlie hunched over a keyboard while Helen Hunt (and the male lead in "Twister") fly by? 
[09/08 12:38] <02charlie> lol
[09/08 12:38] <02charlie> what gives you that picture?
[09/08 12:39] <dsk_hbe> what a cool movie that was ;-)
[09/08 12:43] <JimE_zOS> I don't know exactly.  Maybe UR willingness to take the laptop anywhere while oncall. 
[09/08 12:43] <JimE_zOS> I'm not that brave. 
[09/08 12:43] <JimE_zOS> or maybe I'm too old school. 
[09/08 12:43] <02charlie> ah
[09/08 12:44] <dsk_hbe> the one time I had to use the phone to connect to it it was too slow for me bordering on unusable so I doubt I'll ever bother unless forced again
[09/08 12:45] <JimE_zOS> anyway.....FCards changed (including the MFR limit bump), compared, run, compared against live prod, rename scheduled and history updated. 
[09/08 12:45] <JimE_zOS> I welcome UR checking. 
[09/08 12:45] <dsk_hbe> thankfully AT&T internet is more reliable than the stuff Jim lives with ;-)
[09/08 12:57] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni got the flowers and the puppy and loved it.. She thanked all of you! :-)
[09/08 12:57] <06Amit_zOS> back btw
[09/08 12:57] <dsk_hbe> oh good!!
[09/08 13:03] <JimE_zOS> the bridge 2.0 runs continue to look good (in SAVRS) so I'm going to continue not watching. 
[09/08 13:04] <JimE_zOS> about 20 minutes to make the transitioni and OPS doesn't get to botch anything 
[09/08 13:28] <JimE_zOS> change created for my next oncall to do Bridge 2.0 for the LFD/selected SA copies. 
[09/08 13:29] <JimE_zOS> I finished my rexx version of NEWEOJ modify command. 
[09/08 13:29] <JimE_zOS> so I'll leave things in SR briding alone until my next change window 
[09/08 13:29] <JimE_zOS> but when I get there, I'll remove the NEWEOJ modify commands and replace that with my new code to modify the LVT STCKS.
[09/08 13:30] <JimE_zOS> which I'll run as part of bridge COLD. 
[09/08 13:30] <JimE_zOS> so we'll be ready to go to bridge immediately 
[09/08 13:31] <JimE_zOS> the LFDs won't need this, BTW, because they already ignore their "S" records. 
[09/08 13:31] <dsk_hbe> once a curse, now a benefit ;-)
[09/08 13:31] <JimE_zOS> I hate to give credit to Tim Dour for things, but I think he had that right. 
[09/08 13:31] <JimE_zOS> although at the time, our level of automation didn't really tolerate that notion. 
[09/08 13:32] <JimE_zOS> yeah, OK, he was still wrong. 
[09/08 13:32] <dsk_hbe> whew, good ;-)
[09/08 13:32] <JimE_zOS> I feel so much better. 
[09/08 13:32] <JimE_zOS> crap, I'm out of cold coffee to put in my new microwave. 
[09/08 13:32] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[09/08 13:33] <02charlie> lol
[09/08 13:34] <JimE_zOS> k...that leaves me one other matter to clean-up for Charlie. 
[09/08 13:34] <JimE_zOS> ...the implementation group of the F-Card rename. 
[09/08 13:35] <JimE_zOS> I'm a dolt and let it default to me/our group. 
[09/08 13:35] <JimE_zOS> it needs to be OPS. 
[09/08 13:35] <JimE_zOS> and Justin isn't here today 
[09/08 13:35] <JimE_zOS> (my ACE in the hole) 
[09/08 13:35] <dsk_hbe> Justin is the best
[09/08 13:35] <02charlie> what about lorraine, can she fix it?
[09/08 13:36] <JimE_zOS> perhaps. 
[09/08 13:36] <02charlie> justin is great btw
[09/08 13:36] <JimE_zOS> high percentage of fatal error when dealing with Lorraine. 
[09/08 13:36] <JimE_zOS> Lorraine would be "change proto-matter"
[09/08 13:36] <02charlie> yeah, but this is just one thing, hopefully
[09/08 13:36] <02charlie> rotflmao
[09/08 13:37] <JimE_zOS> I can certainly try. 
[09/08 13:39] <06Amit_zOS> I would love to give my expert opinion if I could.. lol
[09/08 13:44] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/08 13:46] <02charlie> brb
[09/08 14:02] <JimE_zOS> and, as if by magic, the F-Card rename change is out of our queue. 
[09/08 14:02] <02charlie> excellent!
[09/08 14:02] <02charlie> did lorraine o it?
[09/08 14:02] <JimE_zOS> thanks for noticing, Charlie 
[09/08 14:02] <JimE_zOS> she did, yes. 
[09/08 14:02] <JimE_zOS> and we traded additional emails too. 
[09/08 14:03] <02charlie> sure, i didnt want either one of us to be up at 0200 :D
[09/08 14:03] <JimE_zOS> it seems my next oncall falls during an MMW so there is Borg style resistance to my change. 
[09/08 14:03] <JimE_zOS> I'm there. 
[09/08 14:03] <dsk_hbe> well if thatisn't a perfect time to do it, I don't know what is
[09/08 14:03] <JimE_zOS> my sleep schedule is still goofed. 
[09/08 14:03] <JimE_zOS> agree, Debbie. 
[09/08 14:03] <JimE_zOS> it is easier to get in trouble with an LFD. 
[09/08 14:04] <JimE_zOS> so the bonus of us being down is welcome. 
[09/08 14:04] <02charlie> didnt STNG plant a virus into the Borg collective to defeat them? can we do the same thing? ;)
[09/08 14:04] <02charlie> it was, after all, a computer virus :D
[09/08 14:04] <JimE_zOS> Change Mgt is more insideous than the Borg
[09/08 14:04] <02charlie> lol

[09/08 14:21] <02charlie> excellent news on the bridge 2.0 change
[09/08 14:21] <02charlie> i rebooted everything on my end btw, when it dropped y connection i rebooted router, and pc
[09/08 14:23] <02charlie> ok <nsfw language>. That's mark's f-i-l and justin's grandfather, right?
[09/08 14:24] <dsk_hbe> huh?  what language are you speaking? ;-)
[09/08 14:25] <02charlie> hey amit, dod you want to go thru the mfr chasm change tonight? i dont know you've done one and i'm happy to give you the opportunity, if you wanted (it's ok to say no, too)
[09/08 14:25] <dsk_hbe> oic... reading email now
[09/08 14:25] <02charlie> doesnt matter the language, it's still nsfw :)
[09/08 14:25] <dsk_hbe> nsfw??
[09/08 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> not safe for work
[09/08 14:25] <02charlie> jinx!
[09/08 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> jixn
[09/08 14:25] <dsk_hbe> I still don't get the application here
[09/08 14:26] <06Amit_zOS> What time is it tonight Charlie?
[09/08 14:27] <02charlie> insert your favorite expletive deleted term in place of the bracketed statement :) 
[09/08 14:27] <02charlie> 2000
[09/08 14:27] <dsk_hbe> allrighty
[09/08 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> oh 20:00.. I am not sure i will be home Charlie.. 
[09/08 14:29] <06Amit_zOS> if i happen to be, i will definitely come online
[09/08 14:30] <02charlie> not an issue, i just didnt want to take the opportunity away from you
[09/08 14:32] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah, Charlie....good point.  That's why Justin isn't here today. Duh. 
[09/08 14:45] <02charlie> ah, and thanks for the explanation, Jim, about the PD connections. Why are there TD connections to 80 & 89? can they be removed?
[09/08 14:46] <JimE_zOS> we actually have those FABC LFD copies. 
[09/08 14:46] <JimE_zOS> we aren't currently running them, but they remain part of the config.
[09/08 14:46] <02charlie> ah, ok
[09/08 15:10] <dsk_hbe> grrrr... grrrrr...grrrr... just spun my wheels for a half hour because I faield to change my stats job from STCK, which the LCRE stats demand... to STCG, which the CRE stats (and everythign else in the world) now uses... once again I am reminded of how much Neigowski failed us 
[09/08 15:11] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah....epic fail. 
[09/08 15:12] <JimE_zOS> and I'll point out that STCG was created by Wayne, after the mess, so we could deal better. 
[09/08 15:12] <JimE_zOS> Mark didn't even have that. 
[09/08 15:12] <dsk_hbe> thank goodness... my brain can't be expected to do timezone math!
[09/08 15:31] <02charlie> are those fields in the diskstat records?
[09/08 15:32] <JimE_zOS> folks, I think I'm gonna call it a day 
[09/08 15:32] <dsk_hbe> yeah, the storeclock 
[09/08 15:32] <JimE_zOS> I'd like to put the kitchen back in working order before Martha returns 
[09/08 15:32] <02charlie> so you didnt take the day off then, i'm assuming :)
[09/08 15:32] <dsk_hbe> have a good weekend, Jim!!
[09/08 15:33] <JimE_zOS> I flaked for more of the day than I should have, but, no, I didn't take the day. 
[09/08 15:33] <JimE_zOS> Maybe Monday. 
[09/08 15:33] <06Amit_zOS> Have a good weekend !
[09/08 15:33] <02charlie> different versions of the STCK values? local, gmt, etc?
[09/08 15:33] <JimE_zOS> I need to make a run to Lima, perhaps that would be a good day
[09/08 15:33] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[09/08 15:33] <02charlie> well, feel free to do what you need to do
[09/08 15:33] <JimE_zOS> time stamps you see (like in the diary) are local time. 
[09/08 15:33] <dsk_hbe> it's an ugly history of when Marc Niegowski converted our world to GMT, Charlie... I choose not to relive it ;-)
[09/08 15:34] <JimE_zOS> but some are GMT 
[09/08 15:34] <JimE_zOS> so you need the GMT offset to make the transformatino.
[09/08 15:34] <JimE_zOS> it is always a mixed bag. 
[09/08 15:34] <02charlie> ugly
[09/08 15:34] <dsk_hbe> it is an-noy-ying!!!
[09/08 15:34] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[09/08 15:34] <dsk_hbe> too many ys there... shoot me now
[09/08 15:35] <02charlie> portman just sent me this: Tim Allen: Electricity can be dangerous. My nephew tried to stick a penny into a plug. Whoever said a penny doesn't go far didn't see him shoot across that floor. I told him he was grounded.
[09/08 15:35] <JimE_zOS> grab a STCK, get a silly answer, do offset math and try again. 
[09/08 15:35] <dsk_hbe> booooo
[09/08 15:36] <JimE_zOS> I'll leave without comment. 
[09/08 15:36] <JimE_zOS> :-)
[09/08 15:36] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[09/08 15:36] <JimE_zOS> G & Q night, all

[09/11 09:51] <02charlie> did i originally have back to back weeks?
[09/11 09:51] <dsk_hbe> hey Charlie, did you mean for your turnover to stop so quickly or were you bitten by the turnover chopping bug?  
[09/11 09:51] <dsk_hbe> no, the weeks we traded were 9/25 and 10/2
[09/11 09:52] <02charlie> oh, i dodnt look at how the email came out, lmc
[09/11 09:52] <dsk_hbe> I just noticed there wasn't a period at the end so I wondered

[09/11 09:55] <dsk_hbe> I figured
[09/11 09:55] <06Amit_zOS> i will tell them that it Annoys Debbie.. ;) hopefully they will change it then!
[09/11 09:56] <02charlie> last thing i want to do is annoy debbie :)
[09/11 09:56] <dsk_hbe> I start every oncall week annoyed... I don't need mroe ;-)
[09/11 09:57] <dsk_hbe> allright... which frickin' form of my ID do they want???
[09/11 09:57] <06Amit_zOS> legal/nenminax 
[09/11 09:58] <dsk_hbe> thanks... I tried so many I was afraid if I kept trying they'd hose my ID :-/
[09/11 09:58] <02charlie> isnt that legal\nenminax?
[09/11 09:59] <dsk_hbe> it's not letting me in no matter what I give it :-/
[09/11 09:59] <dsk_hbe> if I have to call the hdsk I'm going to be oh so very annoyed
[09/11 09:59] <06Amit_zOS> i dunno.. they had a format promt... either '/' or '\'
[09/11 09:59] <dsk_hbe> I didn't get the prompt until after I tried what you told me to try, which had the wrong forward slash... maybe that third try bit me... wonderful
[09/11 10:00] <06Amit_zOS> sorry
[09/11 10:01] <dsk_hbe> not your fault... I had also tried the other format they said as my second attempt and that didn't work either... grrrr...
[09/11 10:49] <02charlie> squeeze dw, imagine that :)
[09/11 10:49] <dsk_hbe> way overdue
[09/11 10:50] <02charlie> i told chris saturday that jim demanded a silver briefcase full of cash to work on DW :)
[09/11 10:51] <dsk_hbe> Chris who?
[09/11 10:57] <dsk_hbe> I love your turnover, Charlie!  I think that JCL error is what Jim said he was going to institute to protect us from the non-OPC restarts... yay!!!
[09/11 11:01] <06Amit_zOS> back
[09/11 11:01] <06Amit_zOS> do you guys mind if i drop my car at the autoshop and uber back in?  be about half an hour

[09/11 11:03] <dsk_hbe> ah
[09/11 11:03] <02charlie> i had turned off merlin for the meeting
[09/11 11:29] <dsk_hbe> hmmm... it was bugging me so I foudn where Jim said what he changed... he only mentioend FABC and only SA/LFD... says he put synatx errors in their startup procs so OPS couldn't start them outside OPC.  So now I wonder what the JCL errors were OPS encounted for DW.
[09/11 11:29] <dsk_hbe> still glad they did though
[09/11 11:29] <02charlie> yeah, i didnt think he had done the world :)
[09/11 11:30] <dsk_hbe> was hoping he decided to add DW to the mix though... oh well... I don't even see JCL errors in the syslog so I have no clue what really happened
[09/11 11:31] <02charlie> and i didnt care enough to look :) 
[09/11 11:31] <dsk_hbe> this was Saturday right?  what time did you start them?
[09/11 11:32] <dsk_hbe> or rather, have OPC start them.
[09/11 11:32] <02charlie> about 1030
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> we actually did talk, because i see this:
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:18] <charlie> chris the numbers you gave me didnt work
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:18] <charlie> and i finally got connected again
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:18] <PSO_ChrisW> call 937-865-6941
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:18] <PSO_ChrisW> opt 1
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:19] <charlie> you gave me 854 :)
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:19] <PSO_ChrisW> sorry
[09/11 11:33] <02charlie> [09/09 10:19] <PSO_ChrisW> typo
[09/11 11:34] <02charlie> so there really arent any tracks in irc
[09/11 11:45] <dsk_hbe> before I forget, I have a doctor appointment I will need to leave on time to get to so I have a chance to get back by 5.  I may actually leave a couple minutes before 3 so hopefully speed it up.
[09/11 11:45] <02charlie> no issue
[09/11 11:56] <Amit_away> back
[09/11 11:56] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/11 11:57] <dsk_hbe> haha, Charlie... I wasn't asking... I think leaving on time doesn't require anyone's permission ;-)
[09/11 11:57] <02charlie> lol
[09/11 11:57] <dsk_hbe> even leaving 5 minutes early, I don't ask ;-)  I'm such a rebel ;-)
[09/11 11:58] <02charlie> hahahaha
[09/11 11:58] <02charlie> it you needed to leave much earlier, that would be fine too
[09/11 11:58] <dsk_hbe> stop it, you ;-)
[09/11 12:00] <06Amit_zOS> I think you worked enough on your PTO time to be asking Debbie! lol :-)
[09/11 12:00] <dsk_hbe> true... we all do... if I were *asking* ;-)
[09/11 12:01] <dsk_hbe> I wonder what they will do for you guys being hourly... I hope you get some big paychecks if that happens ;-)
[09/11 12:02] <06Amit_zOS> nah  i think they will just ask us to leave early on a working day and that will be that
[09/11 12:02] <06Amit_zOS> :-(
[09/11 12:02] <dsk_hbe> well that's not fair to anyone :-/
[09/11 12:03] <06Amit_zOS> but when I get as good as you guys, i'd probably be good;-)
[09/11 12:04] <dsk_hbe> I have no doubt you will be better than me, Amit... you're a smart cookie
[09/11 12:04] <02charlie> (Rule 1 :)
[09/11 12:05] <06Amit_zOS> Thanks Debbie! :-) 
[09/11 12:05] <dsk_hbe> so it must be true per the rule!
[09/11 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> Triveni will be undergoing some physiotherapy in the hospital
[09/11 12:06] <02charlie> yeah, that's normal protocol
[09/11 12:06] <dsk_hbe> so she will be there for a while yet?  I bet she is sick of being there.
[09/11 12:06] <02charlie> when will she be able to leave?
[09/11 12:06] <06Amit_zOS> i havent heard of a discharge plan yet as of yesterday
[09/11 12:07] <06Amit_zOS> yeah, i will get more updates today
[09/11 12:07] <dsk_hbe> thanks!
[09/11 12:07] <06Amit_zOS> we were hoping to get her here sometime this week
[09/11 12:07] <02charlie> btw, folks, probably sunday (i had been planning saturday, but my wife had a friend call and invite me to something on saturday) i'll be heading out to omaha
[09/11 12:08] <06Amit_zOS> nice..
[09/11 12:08] <02charlie> probably stay until sept 30, then leave then and get back on the 30th
[09/11 12:08] <dsk_hbe> I suppose that's ok, Charlie ;-)
[09/11 12:08] <02charlie> lol
[09/11 12:08] <dsk_hbe> hehehehe
[09/11 12:09] <06Amit_zOS> i am taking some time off too starting friday
[09/11 12:09] <02charlie> too bad i was on call or i would have arranged to leave this weekend. of course, i would have been sad to have to have missed the teambuilding exercise ;)
[09/11 12:09] <06Amit_zOS> i have updated the ss calendar
[09/11 12:10] <dsk_hbe> at least you guys are working inside this year!  I woudl have been unhappy doing that outside stuff.
[09/11 12:10] <dsk_hbe> is this your trip to CA, Amit?
[09/11 12:10] <dsk_hbe> I may be forgetting due to you being such the traveling man ;-)
[09/11 12:11] <02charlie> here's an earworm: i was born a traveling man :)
[09/11 12:11] <dsk_hbe> thanks for that ;-)
[09/11 12:11] <06Amit_zOS> yes debbie.. CA and seattle
[09/11 12:11] <02charlie> anytime :)
[09/11 12:11] <dsk_hbe> man, I sound good to myself ;-)
[09/11 12:11] <02charlie> lol
[09/11 12:12] <06Amit_zOS> haha
[09/11 12:24] <02charlie> i'll need to run out sometime tomorrow for about an hour
[09/11 12:34] <02charlie> hey debbie, that's a chasm change isn't it?
[09/11 12:34] <02charlie> jimc created a standard change request for that 
[09/11 12:34] <dsk_hbe> the email with JimC?  yes
[09/11 12:34] <dsk_hbe> I saw you use that last week since we discussed and do plan to take full advantage ;-)
[09/11 12:35] <02charlie> and all you have to do is change the ownership to our team (it defaults to middleware)
[09/11 12:35] <02charlie> :)
[09/11 12:35] <dsk_hbe> yeah, we talked abotu it last week... I told you I wasn't sure it'd let you do that but it did... bless snow ;-)
[09/11 12:35] <02charlie> gesundheit! :D
[09/11 12:35] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/11 12:36] <02charlie> my memory doesnt always go back a full week (or even 3 days :) 
[09/11 12:36] <dsk_hbe> I'm amazed mine held onto that ;-)
[09/11 12:39] <06Amit_zOS> what's does 'STOP TRANSACTION UNMATCHED' mean again?
[09/11 12:39] <06Amit_zOS> whats not matching?
[09/11 12:40] <02charlie> those the CRESRD abends?
[09/11 12:41] <06Amit_zOS> the ioproc ones
[09/11 12:43] <dsk_hbe> I have always told myself it means that the conversation between two OLS copies, i.e. LFD to LSR was broken unexpectedly by an abline or some such.  so the receiving end just made note of it and moved on
[09/11 12:43] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[09/11 12:43] <02charlie> these? IOPROC+022D6
[09/11 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> yes
[09/11 12:44] <dsk_hbe> btw, not that thsi helps a ton in this case, but Charlie has diary doc in our ssmvs sharepoint under the MVS Tools directory
[09/11 12:44] <02charlie> i think those are --->Max Disk<--- 
[09/11 12:44] <06Amit_zOS> wouldnt that mean that such an issue is difficult to recreate in testing and there is nothing much else to do if the system had recovered on its own?
[09/11 12:44] <dsk_hbe> oops... no, under the Shared Documents directory
[09/11 12:46] <02charlie> i'm sure the devs could re-create an issue like that if they needed, but not worth it
[09/11 12:47] <02charlie> we limit how much disk a transaction can use, so we'll shoot it if it exceeds that number
[09/11 12:47] <06Amit_zOS> right.. its difficult
[09/11 12:47] <dsk_hbe> yeah max disk we just watch and if they became a bigger issue we might do something about it but in general they are pig users overstepping... you have to have limits or else they'd impact other users
[09/11 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> understood..
[09/11 12:48] <02charlie> and once we've shot the tx, other pieces might still be inflight to cause the unmatched message
[09/11 12:48] <02charlie> that's my guess
[09/11 12:48] <06Amit_zOS> and thats what i thought.. but charlie, what i want to know is, is there anything we can do about the ticket other than justifying that this is why it happened..
[09/11 12:49] <02charlie> but it's not a mere wag, it's a swag :)
[09/11 12:50] <02charlie> well, it looks to be oone of our piggy users VDFH42
[09/11 12:50] <02charlie> not a thing. the system is designed to protect itself and other users from that kind of behavior
[09/11 12:53] <06Amit_zOS> yeah.. so nothing to do there
[09/11 13:00] <02charlie> correct
[09/11 13:05] <06Amit_zOS> brb
[09/11 13:07] <02charlie> brb
[09/11 14:06] <06Amit_zOS> b
[09/11 14:17] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, woudl you like to make a change for Vickie?  I'm in her meeting and she said she'd send a formal note, but if you are available, you could get started.
[09/11 14:17] <06Amit_zOS> Sure
[09/11 14:18] <06Amit_zOS> whats the change?
[09/11 14:19] <dsk_hbe> she just wants us to change C1 back to using TWF=8.  so, the same change we made before.  BG and Fg both in NZ00.PROD.STARTUP.PRCLIB(C1$SRCHV) on SYSD, E, P, and H.
[09/11 14:20] <06Amit_zOS> ok.. this is for today ?
[09/11 14:20] <dsk_hbe> no need to make a backup, when Jim changed it back to 01 for her he left the x1$srchv backup in place
[09/11 14:20] <dsk_hbe> yes... if you get it done before C1 starts up, it'll get picked up today.
[09/11 14:22] <06Amit_zOS> got it
[09/11 14:22] <dsk_hbe> thanks!  Her meeting just ended, which is unusual... was afraid it'd take the better part of the hour and then I had to run, but if you are good with it, thanks very much!
[09/11 14:24] <06Amit_zOS> Sure Debbie.. leave whenever you feel like..
[09/11 14:24] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[09/11 14:24] <06Amit_zOS> im sure i can handle this
[09/11 14:24] <06Amit_zOS> :)
[09/11 14:24] <dsk_hbe> me too!  I probably insulted you by telling you too much detail ;-)
[09/11 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> No debbie... i'd certainly appreciate all info given.. no need to holdback on info!
[09/11 14:25] <06Amit_zOS> and it would probably help me anyway :P
[09/11 14:25] <dsk_hbe> cool :-)
[09/11 14:35] <06Amit_zOS> made the twf changes in sys d, e, p and h
[09/11 14:36] <06Amit_zOS> SET FGTWF='TWF='',TWF=08'''
[09/11 14:36] <dsk_hbe> spiffy! thanks!
[09/11 14:36] <06Amit_zOS> SET BGTWF='TWF='',TWF=08'''
[09/11 14:36] <dsk_hbe> perfect
[09/11 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> now Jim had mentioned this helps in an N-way merge of the answer sets (or SAF's and SAI's).. any idea what 8 means here? 8-way merge?
[09/11 14:38] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[09/11 14:39] <dsk_hbe> yes, 8-way
[09/11 14:39] <02charlie> jinx!
[09/11 14:39] <dsk_hbe> you can't jinx if you don't type someting, silly
[09/11 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> jinx? you must have thought it?!
[09/11 14:39] <dsk_hbe> jonx!
[09/11 14:39] <06Amit_zOS> jinx @debbie!
[09/11 14:39] <dsk_hbe> see how that works ;-)
[09/11 14:40] <02charlie> i had started typing and made a typo so i handt sent it yet
[09/11 14:40] <dsk_hbe> aw man, you win... in my haste I typo'd :~)
[09/11 14:40] <02charlie> lol
[09/11 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> and whats the setting in prod right now? 
[09/11 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> 8 again?
[09/11 14:41] <dsk_hbe> I think it's only at 1 in prod
[09/11 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> i see
[09/11 14:41] <dsk_hbe> cehck the pz00 dataset
[09/11 14:41] <dsk_hbe> or a started job
[09/11 14:41] <06Amit_zOS> so we are looking if we can increase it 
[09/11 14:42] <dsk_hbe> yeah, she's evaluating via C1
[09/11 14:42] <dsk_hbe> she said in the meeting it only showed a minor different but it depends on what searches they ran through it.
[09/11 14:43] <06Amit_zOS> whats the memer name there?
[09/11 14:43] <dsk_hbe> I gotta sign on to see... woudl have srchv on the end
[09/11 14:43] <06Amit_zOS> nevermind i will find out
[09/11 14:44] <dsk_hbe> sr$srchv... I win ;-)
[09/11 14:44] <dsk_hbe> it's all about winning
[09/11 14:44] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/11 14:44] <dsk_hbe> if I were actually that competitive I'd probably be REALLY annoying ;-)
[09/11 14:44] <06Amit_zOS> i am in the wrong pds i think
[09/11 14:45] <06Amit_zOS> PZ00.PROD.STARTUP.PRCLIB is not it is it?
[09/11 14:45] <dsk_hbe> you may not find it on sysd,e,p,h
[09/11 14:45] <dsk_hbe> at least not the same one as prod uses maybe... never looked
[09/11 14:45] <06Amit_zOS> im on c
[09/11 14:45] <06Amit_zOS> checking into i
[09/11 14:46] <dsk_hbe> oh no... you gotta be on the external cluster... or just on C, do to IOF and tyep 'at i' that'll take you to sysi stuff and you can peek at an SR running
[09/11 14:46] <dsk_hbe> I'd say jinx but that is kinda worn out for the day ;-)
[09/11 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> lol
[09/11 14:47] <06Amit_zOS> and it is 1 as you said
[09/11 14:48] <06Amit_zOS> id reference rule 1 at this instance again but again.. its kinda obvious now 
[09/11 14:49] <06Amit_zOS> :P
[09/11 14:49] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/11 14:49] <dsk_hbe> youpeople are so deluded by that topic ;-)
[09/11 14:50] <02charlie> lol
[09/11 14:50] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, I will probably be doing that change I've been emailing with JimC about this weekend for PROD/DW, but if you are interested in doing FABC, we can work on it tomorrow.
[09/11 14:50] <06Amit_zOS> sure.. we can work on that!
[09/11 14:51] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[09/11 14:54] <dsk_hbe> I think I am going to go ahead and head out.  I'll check back in when I get back in case you guys have anything to turn over to me.    
[09/11 14:54] <dsk_hbe> Cya later!

[09/11 16:57] <02charlie> bye amit
[09/11 16:57] <02charlie> thx u 2
[09/11 17:23] <dsk_away> sigh.... so much for leaving early
[09/11 17:24] <02charlie> oh, for getting into the dr sooner
[09/11 17:24] <dsk_away> yeah... waiting room was packed
[09/11 17:24] <02charlie> i had one dr, no matter when you went, you waited 3 hrs
[09/11 17:24] <02charlie> and another, if you got the 1st appt, you might be in and out
[09/11 17:25] <02charlie> but after that, all bets were off
[09/11 17:25] <dsk_away> this was unusual, but it's the oncologist so I guess that kinda thing can be hard to guage
[09/11 17:25] <02charlie> oh, yeah. everything ok?
[09/11 17:25] <dsk_away> yeah, just routine checkup... i go to once a year after January, yay!
[09/11 17:26] <02charlie> excellent!
[09/11 17:26] <02charlie> hey, got a rountine to convert a vb file to a fb 80 one?
[09/11 17:26] <dsk_away> no I sure don't, sorry!
[09/11 17:26] <02charlie> my gener doesnt do it, short records have nulls which is bad
[09/11 17:26] <02charlie> i'm trying to figure out how to get sort to do it
[09/11 17:27] <dsk_away> maybe Jim will

[09/11 19:49] <06Amit_ZOS> use the VTOF option 
[09/11 19:49] <06Amit_ZOS> did you find it eventually?
[09/11 19:50] <06Amit_ZOS> i realize im a bit late to read this... lol
[09/11 20:48] <dsk_away> see... soooo smart ;-)
[09/11 21:02] <02charlie> yeah, i finally figured out how to make sort work

[09/12 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> Debbie.. did you catch the 3am thing again yesterday?
[09/12 10:12] <dsk_hbe> the 3am thing?
[09/12 10:13] <02charlie> amit commented on the high darts then
[09/12 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> the high arts that happen exactly at 3
[09/12 10:13] <02charlie> jinx
[09/12 10:13] <dsk_hbe> haven't had a chance to open my jobs yet... same guy, Amit?
[09/12 10:13] <dsk_hbe> and you commented on it?  I don't see anything in irc... weird
[09/12 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> different ids
[09/12 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> not the same
[09/12 10:14] <dsk_hbe> victims I guess
[09/12 10:14] <02charlie> [09/11 14:58] <Amit_zOS> and for when Debbie is back, i think the old 3am issue may be trying to resurface:
[09/12 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> so i dont think its 1 user causing it
[09/12 10:16] <dsk_hbe> ok, so you made the comment yeterday... yeah, missed your comment... were you seeing that in Sunday reports or same day reports?  I'll get to yesterday's reports in a sec.  My email decided to blow up and is keeping me busy ;-)
[09/12 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i saw them when i ran diaries for yesterday
[09/12 10:19] <dsk_hbe> kthx!
[09/12 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> and microsoft servers have some serious issues recently i guess.. lync, outlook.. there are servers down there
[09/12 10:20] <06Amit_ZOS> so if you are doing a search on emails, there are chances that some emails may not be included
[09/12 10:20] <dsk_hbe> when I get caught up, we can talk abotu how I decided who was to blame for that if you want.  It actually involved using that real time SOR job that I showed you last week if you wanted to do the checking same day... but today we can use the next day job and see if it's the same guy
[09/12 10:21] <dsk_hbe> oh fancy, Amit... are you saying that's an issue bigger than our company?
[09/12 10:21] <06Amit_ZOS> i dunno.. but it looks like it.. lol
[09/12 10:22] <dsk_hbe> wow, messy!
[09/12 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> or maybe its just because of irma, they might be just refering to that
[09/12 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> who knows
[09/12 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> anyway... yes.. SOR jobs..
[09/12 10:22] <06Amit_ZOS> will look it
[09/12 10:22] <dsk_hbe> oh yeah, maybe
[09/12 10:23] <06Amit_ZOS> and its probably this guy ZC84DK?
[09/12 10:24] <dsk_hbe> if oyu are going to play with SORs, one suggestion for somethign like this... be sure to zone in tight on the timeframe.  I might give it 02:55-03:00 or maybe a little after 03:00
[09/12 10:24] <dsk_hbe> probably right Amit... he's still sitting in my job isn't he ;-)
[09/12 10:24] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/12 10:25] <06Amit_ZOS> im just going to read that mail that you had forwarded to me
[09/12 10:25] <dsk_hbe> cool
[09/12 10:27] <dsk_hbe> did I forward you the one where Steve Hankins says the diligence healthcheck shoudl hit the date ranges this user needs?  We must just be missing some timing window on that if that is accurate.  I think I'll sub the healthcheck's RAP report and see if it shows anything helpful
[09/12 10:27] <06Amit_ZOS> i dont think i have that mail..
[09/12 10:28] <dsk_hbe> forwarded
[09/12 10:29] <06Amit_ZOS> thank you!
[09/12 10:41] <06Amit_ZOS> if bg switch is ON, we get the fg data right? (IF SPCSW ON 64)
[09/12 10:44] <dsk_hbe> does a FLUNK follow that?
[09/12 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> yes
[09/12 10:44] <dsk_hbe> if so, yes, you'd get FG
[09/12 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> gotcha
[09/12 10:44] <dsk_hbe> copying you on a note on what I see for the Diligence ID, Amit.
[09/12 10:44] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/12 10:47] <06Amit_ZOS> man, that job does take some time
[09/12 10:48] <dsk_hbe> the SOR job?  yeah, but it used to take a REALLY long time ;-)  so this is good ;-)
[09/12 10:48] <06Amit_ZOS> i better get coffee before this guy finishes
[09/12 10:49] <06Amit_ZOS> And Anita is back in this week right? i seem like recalling she was out on a PTO last week
[09/12 10:50] <dsk_hbe> she is, yes

[09/12 10:52] <JimE_zOS> howdy 
[09/12 10:52] <dsk_hbe> HIya, Jim
[09/12 10:52] <02charlie> morning jim
[09/12 10:54] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, was it?
[09/12 10:54] <JimE_zOS> back from major maint. weekend Mark Logic/PFD meeting with Anita and Rita 
[09/12 10:55] <dsk_hbe> ew, really sorry about that last one
[09/12 10:55] <JimE_zOS> stopping the product for the entire weekend wasn't the solution they had hoped to get. 
[09/12 10:55] <dsk_hbe> or is that all one meeting... either way, ew
[09/12 10:55] <JimE_zOS> chasm variable changes at 4am. 
[09/12 10:55] <JimE_zOS> just great. 
[09/12 10:55] <dsk_hbe> :-(
[09/12 10:56] <02charlie> well, pfd is out of the bcp weekend too
[09/12 10:58] <dsk_hbe> I was surprised to see TP on that list
[09/12 10:58] <dsk_hbe> why is Jim havign to do painful things for somethign that is 'unsupported'?
[09/12 10:59] <06Amit_ZOS> because he see the matrix
[09/12 10:59] <02charlie> lol
[09/12 10:59] <JimE_zOS> cause we own the PFD/TPJorm stuff, I guess. 
[09/12 10:59] <JimE_zOS> yeah, and that. 
[09/12 11:00] <JimE_zOS> I can see those 3D pictures within a picture. 
[09/12 11:00] <JimE_zOS> very easily, actually 
[09/12 11:00] <02charlie> so can i

[09/12 11:01] <06Amit_ZOS> thats some bad pasting..
[09/12 11:01] <06Amit_ZOS> sorry
[09/12 11:01] <06Amit_ZOS> just wanted to highlight the 6674 DB#
[09/12 11:01] <02charlie> actually, i guess it's not pfd, but tp that's not in bcp
[09/12 11:03] <JimE_zOS> coffee...splash....brb
[09/12 11:03] <dsk_hbe> yeah, that is actually a low count, Amit... we allow up to 10500 now %-}
[09/12 11:03] <06Amit_ZOS> oh wow..
[09/12 11:04] <06Amit_ZOS> oh is that the MFR limit!???????????????????
[09/12 11:04] <dsk_hbe> yeah!
[09/12 11:04] <06Amit_ZOS> Oh wow!!
[09/12 11:04] <06Amit_ZOS> Nice!
[09/12 11:04] <06Amit_ZOS> good learning!
[09/12 11:05] <06Amit_ZOS> and would that mean, we allow 10500 bmaps to be created if needed? (unlikely i hope)
[09/12 11:06] <dsk_hbe> no, the bmaps will represent a cluster of bases... let me find a job to see if Ic an make sure I am not lying to you ;-)  sec
[09/12 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> i see.. so its not a 1 to 1 thing.. its 1 to many... 1 bmap for multible db's
[09/12 11:07] <06Amit_ZOS> *mulitple
[09/12 11:08] <dsk_hbe> yes, but depending on what the bitmap is for, one database can be in several of them.
[09/12 11:08] <dsk_hbe> Here is a dump of CL4's current bitmap area - JOB(UKAMBDSU,168933)  on sysc
[09/12 11:08] <06Amit_ZOS> understood
[09/12 11:09] <dsk_hbe> so that first one in the report - JNORM-DATE-OPT-GEQ-2014-09-12 - is a 3 year jnorm bitmap... makes searching data exactly 3 years old faster... since a lot of the web applications, Rosetta, etc., offer a 3year option
[09/12 11:10] <02charlie> archer CAS sounds like a cartoon detective for adults :)
[09/12 11:10] <02charlie> i dont have a clue what that application is
[09/12 11:10] <dsk_hbe> I don't know what it really is but CAS = Chemical Abstracts Service to me ;-)
[09/12 11:11] <dsk_hbe> I worked there 10 years 
[09/12 11:39] <JimE_zOS> back with coffee, information on IPL Prep from Doug and an approach to automation changes to quiet the old bridging messages which are now noise. 
[09/12 11:41] <02charlie> ah, yeah, im not certain that's what they mean by it (sorry, in my meeting and actually was paying attention) mtg over noe
[09/12 11:41] <dsk_hbe> I doubt it as well ;-)
[09/12 11:50] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, I decided to run that 02:55-03:00 SOR report, sorting on USRID and giving totals by USRID.  I reran it with the code inline in case you wanted to see what I did in the code - JOB(UKAMBDS3,38712) on SYSW.  I think we have a different Diligence user to suspect this time - 0PG3BC had 1504 CPU seconds in that 5 minutes time.
[09/12 11:51] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/12 11:51] <dsk_hbe> I'm going to add in the bmap report to see if he, too, had to cache a lot of bitmaps
[09/12 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> interesting
[09/12 12:01] <06Amit_ZOS> and he was not obvious because we usually track people with high cpu seconds throughout the day... not the intensity.. (not cpu/ minute or per hour)
[09/12 12:02] <dsk_hbe> yeah, so I suspect he is in the same boat aas the other guy was... having to cache his own bitmaps
[09/12 12:02] <dsk_hbe> anyone know how in MSP supports Quikjob?
[09/12 12:03] <02charlie> no
[09/12 12:03] <02charlie> portman, maybe?
[09/12 12:03] <06Amit_ZOS> not a clue
[09/12 12:03] <dsk_hbe> I'll just pick a few names to email.  It's spitting out a warnign in my jobs about something expiring
[09/12 12:05] <dsk_hbe> Portman out so I sent it to Herby and SHumate
[09/12 12:08] <dsk_hbe> ok, Amit, number of BMAP added job is done - JOB(UKAMBDS3,38771)  That user cached 111,401... yuck
[09/12 12:09] <dsk_hbe> and his searches were PQs so gonna make sure they aren't new
[09/12 12:09] <dsk_hbe> (btw, I know this cause he has the x01 bit on in the spcsw column)
[09/12 12:12] <dsk_hbe> pqs tool tells me 3 webIDs have PQs... ugh... gonna run a rap report and see fi that whittles down which one I need to look at
[09/12 12:12] <dsk_hbe> oops... 5 webids
[09/12 12:14] <dsk_hbe> rap report in case you want to peek - http://rap:81/RAP/tmp/PSUB17971/results.htm  It tells me webID TIMOTHYBURLAGE had the most searches int hat 5 minutes so I'm going to check his PQs
[09/12 12:16] <dsk_hbe> sampling his 213 searches all were created in 2016, so nothing new.
[09/12 12:16] <dsk_hbe> gonne email back to that chain from earlier
[09/12 12:16] <dsk_hbe> and now I'll stop reporting things I'm doing... just wanted to keep Amit int he loop
[09/12 12:22] <06Amit_ZOS> Thanks Debbie!
[09/12 12:22] <06Amit_ZOS> this helps in building a good though process
[09/12 12:23] <dsk_hbe> fwiw, looks like I missed on excluding BG... I'll see what I did wrong in my code and rerun

[09/12 12:29] <06Amit_ZOS> Good time to retire is always yesterday Debbie! ;-)
[09/12 12:29] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/12 12:30] <06Amit_ZOS> ok.. im gonna fix me some food

[09/12 13:02] <02charlie> copy H1 has already restarted once today
[09/12 13:02] <02charlie> citigroup was at fault
[09/12 13:03] <dsk_hbe> Amit, can we move the FABC chasm change to Thursday?  My day is getting away from me and I still have another user from my jobs to take a look at.
[09/12 13:04] <dsk_hbe> btw, I plan to take everyone out of XM daytime and put me in tonight so I can cover while you guys are out tomorrow.  If I remember, I'll put you guys back in at the end of the shift.
[09/12 13:11] <02charlie> is this week the unix release? or next?
[09/12 13:11] <02charlie> next i'm thinking
[09/12 13:12] <dsk_hbe> yeah next.. always 3rd Thursday
[09/12 13:12] <dsk_hbe> well except that time they did it on the weekend
[09/12 13:12] <02charlie> FYI all, on 9/7 somebody was testing their stuff in prod, because we had an internal id create 11 CREIDR abends because of a mal-formed prodinfo string
[09/12 13:12] <dsk_hbe> shocking
[09/12 13:12] <02charlie> if it has anything to do with the unix release coming up, i hope they've fixed it since then
[09/12 13:22] <JimE_zOS> unix monthly along with Bridge 2.0 and MMW.  I'm looking forward to it. 
[09/12 13:25] <dsk_hbe> :-(
[09/12 13:25] <dsk_hbe> once again they dictate our lives with no input from us on the decision
[09/12 13:26] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure it was fine w/RD. 
[09/12 13:26] <JimE_zOS> and, afterall, what difference does our opinion matter? 
[09/12 13:26] <dsk_hbe> yeah :-(
[09/12 13:27] <JimE_zOS> I'm looking forward to Amit working with RD folks directly 
[09/12 13:27] <dsk_hbe> whats he going to be doing with them?
[09/12 13:27] <JimE_zOS> at team building, I mean. 
[09/12 13:28] <JimE_zOS> Amit is bright...can't wait to see what he thinks of our RD sister group. 
[09/12 13:28] <dsk_hbe> oic... whew... was afraid someone thought it'd be good for him to crosstrain there... unless you got to work with Brian McKee, that'd be a waste of his talents
[09/12 13:28] <JimE_zOS> make sure you spend time with Vickie tomorrow, Amit. 
[09/12 13:29] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[09/12 13:29] <dsk_hbe> and just to be sure you know, he doesn't mean the Vickie Mollett we know and love ;-)
[09/12 13:31] <JimE_zOS> oh, right, Vickie M is Zeus! 
[09/12 13:31] <JimE_zOS> Vickie B is nice

[09/12 13:35] <dsk_hbe> ok, thanks
[09/12 13:36] <dsk_hbe> I'm looking at a user who did a ton o' browses yesterday... may be expected but unusual so looking
[09/12 13:38] <06Amit_zOS> lol.. I had just seen Jim's comment of spending time with Vickie tomorrow.. and i really thought it was about a crosstraining! lo

[09/13 19:31] <06Amit_ZOS> hopefully you will get to see some fun pics soon!
[09/13 19:33] <dsk_away> oh good, glad someone took some.  Last year Eric used the group pic as a Christmas greeting.  It was a very nice picture of everyone.  I just wish Triveni coudl have been there
[09/13 19:34] <06Amit_ZOS> true... it would have been good to have her there with us
[09/13 19:35] <dsk_away> oh well, hopefully she is workign hard at getting better.  I'd better go tend to my whining kitties... they do not let me forget a mealtime :-)  Have a good evening!

[09/14 09:12] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Charlie! :)
[09/14 09:12] <02charlie> good morning amit
[09/14 09:13] <02charlie> was there something you needed yesterday evening?
[09/14 09:13] <06Amit_ZOS> im guessing your trip to the north is done for the week?
[09/14 09:13] <02charlie> yes
[09/14 09:13] <02charlie> did you need something?
[09/14 09:14] <06Amit_ZOS> oh yeah, i wanted some help to find the past fabc monitor datasets
[09/14 09:14] <02charlie> lmc
[09/14 09:16] <02charlie> are you looking for monitor datasets, or diskstat and diary datasets?
[09/14 09:17] <02charlie> i could be wrong (and debbie can correct me when she arrives, although i see she was doing things at 0700 her time this orning :), but i don't think we keep the unloaded monitor datasets longer than a day
[09/14 09:18] <02charlie> because monitors get reused
[09/14 09:19] <06Amit_ZOS> not diskstat or diary... just monitor
[09/14 09:20] <06Amit_ZOS> and jim had given me the name at the time.. i had not noted it down
[09/14 09:20] <06Amit_ZOS> any idea if Jim is coming to office?
[09/14 09:21] <02charlie> dont know, but he will probaby be off tomorrow btw
[09/14 09:21] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 09:25] <02charlie> eg here is a pattern for monitor ds on cl1: NL00.LTASR.FABC.COMN.MONITOR.N*
[09/14 09:27] <06Amit_ZOS> and charlie, if a file is too big for a dasd, how do we store it to tape in jcl? just unit=ctape?
[09/14 09:28] <02charlie> lmc
[09/14 09:31] <02charlie> i think it's unit=cart
[09/14 09:31] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 09:31] <02charlie> you need to specify a label and other items
[09/14 09:31] <02charlie> take a look at 
[09/14 09:32] <02charlie> ULESTCI4 on sysc iof, it creates a cart backup of a file
[09/14 09:33] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/14 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> im trying to merge about 255 files using syncsort
[09/14 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> but sortin is unable to allocate
[09/14 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> no idea why
[09/14 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> could you check? :UNENMAX3 J005320
[09/14 09:35] <02charlie> sure
[09/14 09:37] <02charlie> btw, here's the daily monitor file for fabc, i dont know that we keep any other copies: NE00.LTAED.FABC.MONITOR.DAILY
[09/14 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> yes.. i had found the daily file.. in fact you gave this to me a month ago.. :)
[09/14 09:38] <02charlie> WAY more than 3 days ago, so that's been gone a long time :)
[09/14 09:39] * dsk_away is now known as dsk_hbe
[09/14 09:39] <dsk_hbe> morning
[09/14 09:39] <06Amit_ZOS> yo whasssaap Debbie! :)
[09/14 09:39] <02charlie> morning debbie
[09/14 09:40] <dsk_hbe> LOL, quite the greeting ;-)
[09/14 09:40] <06Amit_ZOS> figured, theRock could use some more swag!
[09/14 09:41] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/14 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> When do you want to do the chasm change Debbie?
[09/14 09:42] <02charlie> im thinking that they're all cart files and you can't allocate a concatenation of tapes (or carts, short for tape CARTridges) the same way you do disk files
[09/14 09:43] <dsk_hbe> oh I think you can, Charlie... just have to use unit=aff=ddname so you don't use more than one tape drive
[09/14 09:43] <02charlie> my ancient memory is telling me there's a parameter you have to specify that it doesnt load the next tape until the last one is finished
[09/14 09:43] <02charlie> RULE 1! :)
[09/14 09:43] <02charlie> and jinx!
[09/14 09:43] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I gave you that one ;-)
[09/14 09:43] <02charlie> lol
[09/14 09:43] <dsk_hbe> just back from my blood-letting so shoving food in my face and can't type fast ;-)
[09/14 09:44] <02charlie> lol
[09/14 09:44] <dsk_hbe> Amit, give me a bit to catch up on email and a couple things with Wayne and then we can set a time, ok?
[09/14 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 09:44] <dsk_hbe> I am not sure  follow what Amit is looking for above... previous days' unloaded monitors for FABC?
[09/14 09:45] <02charlie> and you might as well code disp=old on the files, because you cant share a cart
[09/14 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, when i do it with just 5-10 of those files, it works
[09/14 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> but not with all of them
[09/14 09:45] <dsk_hbe> can you tell me what files you are talking about so I'm sure I follow?
[09/14 09:45] <02charlie> cuz there's a limit to how many tape drives we have
[09/14 09:45] <dsk_hbe> give me an example file name
[09/14 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> old monitor daily files
[09/14 09:46] <06Amit_ZOS> PE00.LPAED.MONITOR.D170829
[09/14 09:46] <dsk_hbe> ah ok, dailies... and not fabc then?
[09/14 09:46] <02charlie> and i'm thinking we dont keep those for fabc
[09/14 09:47] <06Amit_ZOS> not fabc yet.. i figured i can just add them later
[09/14 09:47] <dsk_hbe> ok, fabc talk above threw me... I think it is true that we don't keep unloaded monitors for days for fabc, but you know we do for prod since we talked about that in our meeting lastw eek
[09/14 09:47] <dsk_hbe> don't keep what Charlie, we have like 7 days of dailies for fabc I think... lemme check
[09/14 09:49] <dsk_hbe> yeah they are generational though, named like this - NE00.LTAIC.FABC.BKUP.MONITOR.DAILY.G7810V00
[09/14 09:49] <02charlie> this is the closest i see: STAGE1.NE00.LTAED.FABC.MON.UCF.[MON-SUn]
[09/14 09:49] <02charlie> ah
[09/14 09:49] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 09:49] <dsk_hbe> yeah, that second level of the DSn is different... I can never remember it... had to brute force find it
[09/14 09:50] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, i wasted a lot of trying different masks
[09/14 09:53] <06Amit_ZOS> so what do you suggest i do with that job??
[09/14 09:53] <dsk_hbe> which job, Amit, I'll take a quick peek
[09/14 09:54] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX3 J005320
[09/14 09:55] <dsk_hbe> ok, since those are cart files, you need to put unit=aff=sortin on each one after the first
[09/14 09:55] <dsk_hbe> that'll clear up the tape drve contention... after that let me know if there is still a problem
[09/14 09:56] <06Amit_ZOS> but it works fine when i just try to merge like 30 of them.. so how could that be a problem?
[09/14 09:56] <dsk_hbe> can you show me the job you ran to merge... not sure I know what you mean there
[09/14 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX3 J018840
[09/14 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> that ran fine
[09/14 09:57] <06Amit_ZOS> but with just 30 odd files
[09/14 09:58] <dsk_hbe> see these messages in the job log and how eack device number is different... you are taking up a ton of tape drives and someone is going to yell at you if you run that way again ;-) K D100
[09/14 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/14 09:58] <dsk_hbe> I suspect that means we have somewhere between 30 and a larger number of tape drives and you used a bunch
[09/14 09:58] <06Amit_ZOS> ok so what do i do? unit=aff=sortin?
[09/14 09:59] <dsk_hbe> see how the time stamps are all the same on those tape mounts?  that means you grabbed them all at once.  Once you put the unit=aff=sorting on the DD's you'll see those mount in successive order to the same tape drive
[09/14 10:00] <dsk_hbe> yes, you 2 through teh last DD will need to look like this: 
[09/14 10:00] <dsk_hbe> DSN=PE00.LPAED.MONITOR.D170102,DISP=SHR,UNIT=AFF=SORTIN
[09/14 10:00] <dsk_hbe> boy I hope you can translate my typos ;-)
[09/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> only the last dd?
[09/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> not all of them?
[09/14 10:01] <dsk_hbe> no, every single one except the first 
[09/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> ah i see
[09/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/14 10:01] <06Amit_ZOS> let me try that
[09/14 10:05] <dsk_hbe> boy LA had issues didn't they... I'm enjoying just deleting each of those informer messages ;-)
[09/14 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> how do you delete a tape dsn?
[09/14 10:05] <06Amit_ZOS> d doenst work
[09/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> UNENMAX.MONITOR.MASTER
[09/14 10:06] <dsk_hbe> yeah, been a while lemme see if I have a job
[09/14 10:06] <06Amit_ZOS> created that in the last run
[09/14 10:06] <dsk_hbe> here ya go... see if this will do it, with the approproate dsn and volumes changed of course - MJ.HSTCAT
[09/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> that's jcl not rpf ;-)
[09/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> and cahnge it to old, delete,delete
[09/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> no spaces, unlike my typos
[09/14 10:07] <dsk_hbe> I *think* that will work... we'll see
[09/14 10:09] <dsk_hbe> if that doesn't work, I'll show you how to use TMS
[09/14 10:10] <06Amit_ZOS> its in batch queue right now i think
[09/14 10:10] <dsk_hbe> maybe I won't... not sure I feel comfortable with that... been too long
[09/14 10:11] <dsk_hbe> hey Amit, you need to know about class=y... when we are capped class=y is our group job class and it does not get slowed down like other job classes might
[09/14 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> THIS COPY STEP COULD RUN WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CPU AND ELAPSED TIME WITH MFX ZPCOPY--- do you know how to use this?
[09/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> oops... you didn't see me say change the DISP, you still have DISP=(OLD,CATLG,KEEP)
[09/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> and are all of those volsers really your tapes?
[09/14 10:12] <06Amit_ZOS> i just modified one of them which is the first one
[09/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> dunno what that is Amit
[09/14 10:12] <dsk_hbe> then you need to get rid of the rest
[09/14 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/14 10:13] <06Amit_ZOS> and how do i cancel that job in iof?
[09/14 10:14] <dsk_hbe> with a C line command
[09/14 10:14] <02charlie> pu in the input queue
[09/14 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> and btw, that worked Debbie.. i could run the merge!
[09/14 10:14] <06Amit_ZOS> thanks!
[09/14 10:14] <dsk_hbe> excellent!
[09/14 10:16] <dsk_hbe> don't forget, start using class=y... Wayne tells me he thinks we are already capping :-(
[09/14 10:16] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/14 10:16] <06Amit_ZOS> i made that change
[09/14 10:17] <02charlie> didnt you spass along we were capped for a good portion of yesterday?
[09/14 10:17] <06Amit_ZOS> but it did not delete it
[09/14 10:17] <dsk_hbe> yes, everywhere... it was crazy!
[09/14 10:17] <dsk_hbe> I wonder if we now just need to uncatalogue it... hmmm
[09/14 10:17] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i can do that from tso right?
[09/14 10:18] <dsk_hbe> I believe so
[09/14 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/14 10:18] <02charlie> i was thinking that's all you needed to do, and you dont need to mount the tape to do that
[09/14 10:18] <02charlie> not from tso tho, i think
[09/14 10:18] <02charlie> maybe...just try it
[09/14 10:18] <dsk_hbe> It has been too long since I had to think about tapes
[09/14 10:18] <02charlie> me too
[09/14 10:18] <06Amit_ZOS> i did and it doesnt show in 3.4 now
[09/14 10:19] <02charlie> i remember mounting my own reel tapes
[09/14 10:19] <dsk_hbe> it doesn't show in tms anymore either
[09/14 10:23] <dsk_hbe> fyi, we just checked DW SR diaries and CL3 and CL4 definitely show signs suggesting we're capping, especially in CL3 and CL4... so don't be surprised if we get another ticket for a DW SR taking a U0033
[09/14 10:28] <dsk_hbe> wow, did Vickie do any work or just take pictures yesterday :-)  Glad to have them to look at though :-)

[09/14 12:54] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[09/14 12:55] <dsk_hbe> Amit, I'm going to have to delay the fabc change until I hear back from some questions I sent JimC.  Hopefully he'll answer when he's back from lunch
[09/14 12:55] <JimE_zOS> text (#really?) from the "forkLift" (that would be WRE) that'll he'll be home tonight and tomorrow to help me with drywall. 
[09/14 12:56] <JimE_zOS> it is so much nicer moving a 12 foot sheet of drywall with two people. 
[09/14 12:56] <dsk_hbe> I can't imagine how one woudl ever do it
[09/14 12:56] <JimE_zOS> so I'm thinking of leaving here around 3:30 and taking tomorrow as PTO. 
[09/14 12:56] <JimE_zOS> I do OK with 8 foot pieces, but 12 is just too much for me. 
[09/14 12:57] <dsk_hbe> gotta take advantage of the extra bidy while you can!
[09/14 12:57] <dsk_hbe> body... I won't bother fixing the rest... but WRE is not an old biddy and I wanted to make sure to correct that
[09/14 12:57] <06Amit_ZOS> ok debbie!
[09/14 12:58] <06Amit_ZOS> im afraid i missed anything on irc between 10:51 to 12:54
[09/14 12:58] <JimE_zOS> William and I were out cutting up some downed trees.  I had a running saw in my hand and I was deciding how I wanted to chunk this tree trunk.  I had just decided that 5 pieces seemed right when William walked over and picked up the entire thing.   "Forklift" 
[09/14 12:59] <dsk_hbe> LOL!
[09/14 13:00] <dsk_hbe> doesn't look like you missed much worth repeating, Amit.  I mentioend how Randy already confirmed our guess that we were capping.  I don't think I see much else 
[09/14 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> cool thanks!
[09/14 13:01] <dsk_hbe> Charlie's neighbor's cat is up a tree and Jim is hashtag savvy... all very important for other reasons ;-)
[09/14 13:02] <02charlie> lol
[09/14 13:02] <02charlie> ed didnt answer me, but jhe's back to working his own ticket again
[09/14 13:03] <dsk_hbe> you are likely to experience the wrath of Ed after that ;-)
[09/14 13:03] <02charlie> yeah, i probably shouldnt have made that comment directly in the cone
[09/14 13:04] <dsk_hbe> he can be exhausting
[09/14 13:04] <02charlie> oh, here's his explanation: This was created with the wrong CI. Corrected CI to DrsWFS and assigning to proper level 2 support team.
[09/14 13:04] <dsk_hbe> oh wow... he was kind in his turnover though
[09/14 13:06] <02charlie> yes
[09/14 13:07] <02charlie> it amazes me that he just looked at the Ci to decide where it should go, and didnt look at anything else in the ticket?
[09/14 13:08] <dsk_hbe> awfully trusting of CIs... we all shodul know better than that ;-)
[09/14 13:08] <02charlie> i never look at the CIs
[09/14 13:08] <dsk_hbe> ditto
[09/14 13:20] <JimE_zOS> we do know better.  He just doesn't care.

[09/14 15:13] <dsk_hbe> its not still raining thre is it?
[09/14 15:19] <JimE_zOS> not really, Debbie. 
[09/14 15:20] <JimE_zOS> some drips for trees is about it. 
[09/14 15:20] <JimE_zOS> from trees, that is. 
[09/14 15:20] <dsk_hbe> that's good... can't imagine standing outside the bus waiting your turn
[09/14 15:21] <JimE_zOS> I walked right in.  No line. 
[09/14 15:24] <dsk_hbe> Hey Amit, I want to thank you again for doing the fabc changes... watchign you do those, I think, will make me more comfortable doing prod/dw/pfd tomorrow :-)  Seeing it once helps :-)  
[09/14 15:31] <06Amit_ZOS> lol, you practically hand held me through the process Debbie!  Thank you! :)
[09/14 15:33] <dsk_hbe> I have to admit, it was a bit of the blind leading the blind then ;-)
[09/14 15:34] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/14 15:36] <dsk_hbe> ok, folks, gonna step away.  Yell if you need me back for anything oncaller-ish.  Have a good trip AMit!

[09/18 12:24] <02charlie> and, so you dont feel left out, i'll send you the apple email debbie :)
[09/18 12:24] <dsk_hbe> aw shucks, thx ;-)
[09/18 12:24] <02charlie> lol
[09/18 12:24] <02charlie> apparently, i didnt bring the right pie plates with me
[09/18 12:25] <dsk_hbe> you're in trouble
[09/18 12:26] <02charlie> a friend of ours fed me wednesday evening and gave me three boxes and two large reusable shopping bags full of stuff to bring
[09/18 12:27] <02charlie> one of the boxes was labeled "care package for Kate"
[09/18 12:28] <02charlie> in it was a wicked mug and a clock with the original wicked witch of the west on it, with the quote "all in good time, my pretty, all in good time"
[09/18 12:28] <dsk_hbe> cute :-)
[09/18 12:28] <02charlie> (back story: same friend who used to (and still does) WWOTW imitations, and can sign somewhere over the rainbow backwards
[09/18 12:29] <02charlie> sing, not sign
[09/18 12:29] <dsk_hbe> I never understood the people who were more afraid of the flying monkeys than the scray green witch!
[09/18 12:29] <02charlie> lol
[09/18 12:30] <02charlie> she was scary just as the schoolteacher
[09/18 12:31] <02charlie> i think we're still going to have to go out and get some sheets and blankets
[09/18 12:41] <02charlie> debbie, i said this earlier, but guess i never finsihed the thought: [09/18 12:06] <charlie> we probably wont go anywhere until after obryen goes back after lucnh, she is going to walk over for lunch at 1245
[09/18 12:42] <02charlie> do you want me to take xm until when we do go?
[09/18 12:42] <dsk_hbe> no, I'm good I think... so far no breaker trips... not sure yet whether to be comforted by that or scared
[09/18 12:43] <02charlie> fortunately obreyn needs his coffee in the morning too, so he had a pot made i'm still drinking :)
[09/18 12:43] <dsk_hbe> yay!
[09/18 12:45] <02charlie> but i hope he's not expecting coffee when he comes home from lunch
[09/18 12:45] <dsk_hbe> hahaha, just act as innocent as possible :-)
[09/18 12:45] <02charlie> school is caty-corner from the complex, and there's a dunkin donuts not 100 feet from the front door of the apt
[09/18 12:46] <02charlie> lol. well, he'll KNOW his grandma didnt drink it
[09/18 12:46] <dsk_hbe> :-)
[09/18 12:46] <02charlie> straight black tea (no flavorings, sugar or milk) is her drink
[09/18 12:46] <dsk_hbe> :-P
[09/18 12:47] <02charlie> earl grey, herb teas, all out
[09/18 12:47] <02charlie> so when someone gives her earl grey, i get to drink it :)
[09/18 12:48] <dsk_hbe> I am so stuck on earl grey that nothign else tastes right... and Twinings earl grey to boot
[09/18 12:50] <02charlie> i will drink most teas (although i prefer coffee for the caffeine), but the first teas i liked just straight was lapsang souchong, which is a smoked black tea. nice flavor, and I've come to find chefs use it to make the smoke flavor for dishes
[09/18 12:51] <02charlie> we have a speciality tea shop at the findlay market called churchill's (https://churchillsteas.com/)
[09/18 12:52] <02charlie> i used to (30+ years ago) be able to find lapsang on the shelves in the grocery store, but no more, churchill's carrys it, tho. when i went in to buy some they introduced me to some other smoked teas
[09/18 12:52] <02charlie> you should try some moscow nights, which is a smoked earl grey
[09/18 12:52] <02charlie> absolutely the best tea i have ever had
[09/18 12:52] <dsk_hbe> I'll look for it!
[09/18 12:54] <02charlie> the other one they had me try was russian caravan, it's a combination of lapsan and assam. Not as potent as straigh lapsang, but good
[09/18 12:55] <02charlie> here's a link to the RC: https://www.churchillsteas.com/LOOSE-LEAF-TEA/BLACK-TEA/PURIST-BLACK-TEA/Russian-Caravan-Black-Tea.html
[09/18 12:55] <dsk_hbe> kthx!
[09/18 12:56] <02charlie> and here's the moscow nights: https://www.churchillsteas.com/Moscow-Nights-Black-Tea.html
[09/18 12:56] <02charlie> i'll send you some when i get back home
[09/18 12:57] <02charlie> (you might have to remind me :)
[09/18 12:58] <dsk_hbe> ok!
[09/18 13:00] <02charlie> just reading the app decomm process doc, sounds like a lot of handwaving and magic involved
[09/18 13:00] <02charlie> kind of like fr guido sarducci saying, they just waived, waived that requirement
[09/18 13:08] <02charlie> i'm trying to find a clip
[09/18 13:09] <dsk_hbe> I am marvelled at how quick they expect to just wipe the product away... I wait a really long time before throwing out stuff that's no longer used ;-)
[09/18 13:13] <02charlie> i gave up trying to find the clip
[09/18 13:31] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, Cynthia M is asking if we have a doc of our production HCS connections. 
[09/18 13:31] <JimE_zOS> scares me when people who have no business in our stuff ask questions like that. 
[09/18 13:32] <02charlie> i thought we called those F-cards and .rc files? 
[09/18 13:32] <JimE_zOS> I've pointed her at the batch F-Cards in the hopes that she'll drop the question. 
[09/18 13:32] <JimE_zOS> well, she wants to know connections and the only place to know that, for sure, is the J-Cards 
[09/18 13:32] <JimE_zOS> hcs.rc's can be wrong. 
[09/18 13:32] <02charlie> sure
[09/18 13:33] <JimE_zOS> and, of course, not binding on the MVS copies. 
[09/18 13:33] <dsk_hbe> I am not able to add 2+2 here but Wayne just told me that some sysx datasets have gone missing that affect test systems and VLGs... I wonder if its somehow related 
[09/18 13:33] <02charlie> of course
[09/18 13:33] <JimE_zOS> so if you are looking for fact, gotta go to the J-Cards 
[09/18 13:33] <JimE_zOS> Cynthia asked me last Friday, FWIW. 
[09/18 13:33] <JimE_zOS> so I doubt it is related. 
[09/18 13:33] <02charlie> ah, i noticed paul noted the VLG1 was in error
[09/18 13:34] <02charlie> (earlier today)
[09/18 13:34] <dsk_hbe> do you sit on their channel Charlie?  wow, that is asking for punishment ;-)
[09/18 13:34] <JimE_zOS> Wayne said the same thing to me when he stopped by. 
[09/18 13:34] <02charlie> lol
[09/18 13:34] <JimE_zOS> I didn't do it. 
[09/18 13:34] <02charlie> rotfl
[09/18 13:34] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/18 13:34] <JimE_zOS> although everyone is quick to ask if I changed something. 
[09/18 13:34] <dsk_hbe> :-/
[09/18 13:35] <JimE_zOS> I don't touch their stuff and I hope that they will return the favor. 
[09/18 13:35] <dsk_hbe> definitely
[09/18 13:35] <JimE_zOS> and, if they don't....I'll sick RACF on them. 
[09/18 13:35] <02charlie> lol
[09/18 13:35] <02charlie> (i can hear the hound barking ;)
[09/18 13:56] <JimE_zOS> they (RD) is listed with ALTER level authority in an alarming number of places. 
[09/18 13:56] <JimE_zOS> perhaps an audit is in order.

[09/20 05:51] <triveni> yeah.
[09/20 05:52] <02charlie> yeah, and i'm sure your mother will "mother" you :)

[09/20 07:00] <triveni> am happy to b back
[09/20 07:00] <dsk_hbe> I bet... there is no rest to be had in a hospital bed
[09/20 07:00] <triveni> hahha
[09/20 07:00] <triveni> hospitals are gloomy
[09/20 07:01] <triveni> i still tried my best to have fun
[09/20 07:01] <triveni> physiotherapy sessions were something interesting to look forward to
[09/20 07:01] <dsk_hbe> I am sure you have heard this, but they say that broken bones in younger people heal to be stronger than they were before... you will be bionic!
[09/20 07:02] <triveni> hahha
[09/20 07:02] <triveni> yeah i got a titanium rod
[09/20 07:02] <triveni> so i have super powers now
[09/20 07:02] <dsk_hbe> oh wow
[09/20 07:02] <triveni> heheh
[09/20 07:02] <dsk_hbe> yes you do!
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> i liked the puppy 
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> the stuffed toy
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> not sure who selected it
[09/20 07:03] <dsk_hbe> Tuffy?  sooooo cute ;-)
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> but everyone loved it
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> yeahh
[09/20 07:03] <triveni> he is so cutee
[09/20 07:04] <02charlie> yeah, the tsa people at the sirports will really love you :-/
[09/20 07:04] <02charlie> (titanium rod)
[09/20 07:04] <triveni> hahha
[09/20 07:04] <triveni> yeah
[09/20 07:04] <dsk_hbe> well we told them puppy (teddy bears are so old fashioned ;-) but there was no picture so the florist chose it :-)
[09/20 07:04] <triveni> aww
[09/20 07:04] <triveni> leemme forward it
[09/20 07:04] <dsk_hbe> oh cool!
[09/20 07:13] <dsk_hbe> Cute pictures, Triveni!!!  And Tuffy is cute!
[09/20 07:13] <triveni> yeah he is ;)
[09/20 07:13] <triveni> flowers were so pretty.. everyone loved them
[09/20 07:13] <triveni> and i really felt so good
[09/20 07:15] <dsk_hbe> The Mom in me coudl not imagine you being so far from yur home... and then so far from your family... I can't imagine what you went through.  It made me think of how I'd be if my daughter had something similar... and now I have to renew my passport to quell some of those worries (she has plans to travel to places I'd never dream of.)
[09/20 07:16] <triveni> I normally dont miss my family that much.. coz i am living away from them for a v long time.. but i really did miss them these days..
[09/20 07:16] <triveni> they ll be here soon..
[09/20 07:16] <triveni> it ll be so good to see my mom
[09/20 07:16] <dsk_hbe> I bet!!
[09/20 07:17] <triveni> and she is a v pampering mom.. she ll say all those lovey dovey words.. funny words..but i like it..
[09/20 07:17] <triveni> ;)
[09/20 07:17] <dsk_hbe> yep, Moms are the best ;-)
[09/20 07:17] <triveni> yeah ;)
[09/20 07:22] <02charlie> "restore service first" doh!
[09/20 07:22] <dsk_hbe> sometimes you need to know root cause before that is possible... I like how they think problem solving is a cookbook
[09/20 07:49] <02charlie> yeah
[09/20 07:50] <02charlie> we'll be leaving at 11 for her appt
[09/20 07:51] <dsk_hbe> ok!
[09/20 07:53] <02charlie> hmm, i'm still puzzled by that job
[09/20 07:53] <02charlie> ULESTCD8 J112078
[09/20 07:53] <02charlie> ULESTCD7 J112061
[09/20 07:53] <02charlie> the D8 had the permissions denied errors, the D7 worked fine
[09/20 07:54] <02charlie> and when i log into 1898 and op su2 to u1cre, i can delete the file
[09/20 07:54] <02charlie> any suggestions of whom i should talk to to ask about these behaviors?
[09/20 07:55] <dsk_hbe> I'll look first and see if something jumps out but I have another mtg at 11
[09/20 07:55] <02charlie> k, well im leaving at 11 too, so i'm not expecting to do anything soon :)
[09/20 07:56] <dsk_hbe> cool... hope the appointment is productive
[09/20 07:56] <02charlie> yeah, just checked her email, no notice her records are ready yet (i would have started this process last week)
[09/20 07:57] <dsk_hbe> dang
[09/20 07:57] <02charlie> yeah
[09/20 08:01] <02charlie> oh, im leaving at 11 CDT, not 11 EDT, so it's 12 by this clock that I'll be leaving
[09/20 08:02] <dsk_hbe> oh an hour from now... I forgot where you were again ;-)
[09/20 08:02] <02charlie> well, my watch and this computer are still on EDT, the two phones are on CDT
[09/20 08:11] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, I suspect your issue may be explained in file 5 of the D8 job... see what you think... looks like he got a little confised on where he was maybe?
[09/20 08:12] <dsk_hbe> if that isn't the case, I'll chekc somethign else I'm thinking about after this mtg
[09/20 08:12] <02charlie> no, that's pretty normal
[09/20 08:12] <dsk_hbe> ok, will checkt he other thing after this
[09/20 08:13] <02charlie> ULESTCD8 J016831 had the same error
[09/20 08:13] <dsk_hbe> k, I'd better pay attetion here for now
[09/20 08:13] <02charlie> sure
[09/20 08:22] <dsk_hbe> Anita, 'have to get with Jim about the chasm changes for C1'... RD owns that and told her they don't do it... just saying it here so Jim sees that in case it makes him go hmmm... (related to the zlfd oracle database migration)
[09/20 08:23] <dsk_hbe> maybe he wants to do it to have control
[09/20 08:36] * triveni_brb has joined #theRock
[09/20 08:36] * triveni has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer)
[09/20 08:36] * triveni_brb is now known as triveni
[09/20 08:49] <dsk_hbe> Charlie, I'm not seeing anything that woudl say why you can't delete but it's hard for me to know who you are when you attempt it.  Can you stick a 'whoami' into the process right before you issue the 'rm's to be sure you really are u1cre still?
[09/20 08:53] <02charlie> i can, but it's an automated process that logs into 1898 with the u1cre credentials. there's no op su2 done in the script
[09/20 08:54] <dsk_hbe> sure seems like something thinks you're not u1cre
[09/20 08:56] <02charlie> the only difference between the D7 and D8 jobs is the box they're attaching to
[09/20 08:56] <dsk_hbe> I get that... just offering a suggestion to give more clues
[09/20 08:56] <02charlie> they both (in both steps) use //UENFILE  DD DSN=SHARED.PZ00.SS.UNVCMD(U#SYSSUP),DISP=SHR 
[09/20 08:57] <02charlie> yeah, which is why i was wondering who i might go to to ask
[09/20 08:57] <dsk_hbe> can you ry this first?  or is it too hard?
[09/20 08:58] <02charlie> you mean the whoami?
[09/20 08:58] <dsk_hbe> yeah
[09/20 09:00] <dsk_hbe> I chekced an ubrokerd is running, so I don't think that suggests a UNV issue
[09/20 09:01] <02charlie> ULESTCD8 J086038
[09/20 09:02] <02charlie> so i'm not u1cre, but U#SYSSUP. but that worked on 1897
[09/20 09:02] <02charlie> just didnt on 1989
[09/20 09:03] <dsk_hbe> thinking
[09/20 09:03] <02charlie> i think my wife is in the bathroom, when she comes out i'm sure were leaving
[09/20 09:03] <dsk_hbe> ok, maybe I'll complete my thought by the time you get back ;-)
[09/20 09:04] <02charlie> okie dokie :) thx
[09/20 09:07] * charlie is now known as charlie_away
[09/20 09:33] <dsk_hbe> well, I'm just wasting my time on somethign that I'm sure Jim could answer quickly, so my vote is to wait to see if he has an answer. If he doesn't make it here today (which woudl not surprise me with his later nights), I guess if I were you I'd bug Doug first and see what he thinks.  Meantime if somethign comes to me, I'll let you know.
[09/20 09:45] * JimE_zOS has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 367 seconds)
[09/20 09:55] <dsk_hbe> I'm going to assume no team meeting today
[09/20 09:57] <dsk_hbe> oh good... Connie stepped up
[09/20 09:57] <dsk_hbe> on the C1 thing
[09/20 10:01] <triveni> yes
[09/20 10:01] <triveni> i think there is no meeting
[09/20 10:02] <triveni> jim is not here and charlie too
[09/20 10:02] <dsk_hbe> hopefully Jim is resting still!
[09/20 10:02] <triveni> yeah
[09/20 10:11] <06Amit_ZOS> Heyyy!! Good morning Triveni! Welcome back!!!!!!!!!!! :-D
[09/20 10:11] <triveni> Morning Amit.. :))

[09/20 11:07] <JimE_zOS> I see I was dropped
[09/20 11:07] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[09/20 11:07] <JimE_zOS> the last thing I see is "Jim could answer quickly". 
[09/20 11:07] <JimE_zOS> me Jim or "JimC" Jim ? 
[09/20 11:08] <dsk_hbe> you... Charlie has jobs set up to delete cores/regs/etc from lcre land but the one on psc1898 failed on permissions.  I'm wondering if there is somehow a permission issue for U#SYSSUP on that box.  sec, I'll point you to his job.
[09/20 11:09] <dsk_hbe> this is the last one he ran after I asked him to do a whoami.  He thought he was u1cre, but he is U#SYSSUP... but still, works fine for the other boxes - ULESTCD8 J086038
[09/20 11:10] <JimE_zOS> looking. 
[09/20 11:10] <dsk_hbe> thx
[09/20 11:13] <JimE_zOS> k....issue is here: 
[09/20 11:13] <JimE_zOS> -rw------- 1 u1cre srvappl
[09/20 11:13] <JimE_zOS> only the owner (u1cre) can delete those files 
[09/20 11:13] <JimE_zOS> the group and "other" have no authority. 
[09/20 11:13] <JimE_zOS> sec....one more thing to check. 
[09/20 11:13] <dsk_hbe> I thought I saw the same on psc1897 though
[09/20 11:14] <dsk_hbe> but he didn't rerun a psc1897 job with the whoami so maybe that one switched to u1cre
[09/20 11:14] <dsk_hbe> this was the last of those - ULESTCD7 J112061
[09/20 11:14] <JimE_zOS> I see that we have the encrypted password for u1cre (ie, UNVCMD password file) 
[09/20 11:14] <JimE_zOS> so why not just run as u1cre 
[09/20 11:15] <JimE_zOS> (that was a question) 
[09/20 11:18] * charlie_away is now known as charlie
[09/20 11:19] <02charlie> well, the U#SYSSUP works on 1897
[09/20 11:20] <02charlie> just failed on 1898
[09/20 11:20] <dsk_hbe> yeah, said that
[09/20 11:20] <dsk_hbe> but did you do a whoami on 1897 just to be sure?
[09/20 11:20] * charlie <== broken record
[09/20 11:21] <dsk_hbe> maybe best to just use u1cre like Jim suggests anyway?
[09/20 11:21] <02charlie> Running on psc1897 as U#SYSSUP                          
[09/20 11:21] <02charlie> didnt delete any files this time because they were deleted last night
[09/20 11:21] <JimE_zOS> the permissions are different on 1998

[09/20 11:22] <02charlie> yeah, but
[09/20 11:22] <JimE_zOS> ?
[09/20 11:22] <02charlie> before i cmplete that thought, that should mean again that only u1cre could delete those
[09/20 11:23] <02charlie> but U#SYSSUP does just fine on those
[09/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> you are using MVS rules to decide that, Charlie. 
[09/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> I don't know what level of authority you need on a linux box to delete a file. 
[09/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> more than none, of course.

[09/20 11:23] <JimE_zOS> but maybe "R" is good enough 
[09/20 11:24] <02charlie> same permissions on the regs files on both boxes, and same permissions on the core files too...(sec)

[09/20 11:27] <02charlie> i cant delete the 1898 core
[09/20 11:27] <02charlie> as U#syssup
[09/20 11:28] <JimE_zOS> k....do me a favor.  Turn off the delete stuff so we can build up some test cases, please. 
[09/20 11:28] <02charlie> sure
[09/20 11:28] <JimE_zOS> we can explore next week. 
[09/20 11:29] <02charlie> I'll turn it off for DW only, i'll leave it on for prod and fabc
[09/20 11:29] <JimE_zOS> or just turn off DW 
[09/20 11:30] <JimE_zOS> either will work (but I have a preference) :-)
[09/20 11:30] <dsk_hbe> ah good... you never disappoint me ;-)
[09/20 11:30] <02charlie> i would love to turn off dw, but someone might notice :)

[09/25 08:00] <02charlie> morning amit
[09/25 08:00] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning all! :)
[09/25 08:00] <02charlie> good morning triveni, i missed your greeting 
[09/25 08:01] <triveni> :)
[09/25 08:12] <06Amit_ZOS> What the heck happened to DW today morning!?? lol
[09/25 08:13] <02charlie> i didnt stay around to find out what caused it, and i didnt see any comment from jim about why it failed. it wasnt something he had done as a part of his change work
[09/25 08:13] <06Amit_ZOS> yeah, i thought about that.. 
[09/25 08:13] <06Amit_ZOS> but i knew jim used C1 for most of his testing
[09/25 08:14] <02charlie> from what i could tell, cl 1 and 3 didnt think their copies were down, and then that caused the start apps to fail
[09/25 08:15] <02charlie> but when i looked, the copies were down
[09/25 08:16] <06Amit_ZOS> you cleared stuff from the error list then?
[09/25 08:17] <02charlie> no, i just looked
[09/25 08:17] <02charlie> jim was on the case and i'm not going to stick my nose in unless he wanted the assistance
[09/25 08:17] <06Amit_ZOS> oh.. i see
[09/25 08:18] <06Amit_ZOS> cool.. i will wait for him
[09/25 08:18] <02charlie> that would be very bad
[09/25 08:18] <02charlie> (referring to me sticking my nose in without permission)
[09/25 08:33] <06Amit_ZOS> brb

[09/25 08:44] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[09/25 08:44] <02charlie> morning jim
[09/25 08:44] <02charlie> you're early after all those late nights early monrings
[09/25 08:44] <JimE_zOS> as to DW, I blame Nixon.  
[09/25 08:44] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 08:44] <JimE_zOS> bad, incomplete dependency set-up. 
[09/25 08:45] <JimE_zOS> so when prod CRIT auto-ran (yes, CRIT now runs itself), DW CRIT started too soon
[09/25 08:45] <JimE_zOS> and the copies got all bend
[09/25 08:45] <02charlie> ah
[09/25 08:45] <JimE_zOS> dump renames didn't work correctly 
[09/25 08:45] <JimE_zOS> LVT's were still in use, 
[09/25 08:46] <dsk_hbe> darn that Nixon!
[09/25 08:46] <JimE_zOS> cats living with rabbits. I was awful! 
[09/25 08:46] <02charlie> he opened china, but everything else, it's his fault!
[09/25 08:46] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 08:47] <02charlie> that's very close to a line from ghostbusters
[09/25 08:49] <triveni> lol
[09/25 08:49] <triveni> hey Jim!
[09/25 08:52] <JimE_zOS> howdy T!

[09/25 08:55] <dsk_hbe> Howdy Amit, hope you had a good trip!
[09/25 08:55] <JimE_zOS> RD managed to get another one of their non-human IDs revoked. 
[09/25 08:56] <02charlie> oops
[09/25 08:56] <02charlie> how did that happen?
[09/25 08:56] <06Amit_ZOS> I had a lovely trip! Upper yosemite falls was very challenging!
[09/25 08:57] <dsk_hbe> cl3 BG is currently sucking it up :-(
[09/25 08:57] <dsk_hbe> response wise that is
[09/25 08:57] <JimE_zOS> as long as I haven't misconfigured something, I'm happy 
[09/25 08:57] <dsk_hbe> none of them are great
[09/25 08:57] <06Amit_ZOS> can't imagine how difficult the half dome would have been.. a little relieved we didnt get the permit
[09/25 08:57] <dsk_hbe> yeah, nope, well you have, but only on idiocy orders ;-)
[09/25 08:58] <dsk_hbe> glad you enjoyed it Amit!  sounds like work to me ;-)

[09/25 08:59] <06Amit_ZOS> Jim, if you do the yosemite, i don't think you will need to do the stairs at office for a whole month
[09/25 08:59] <triveni> am trying to think
[09/25 08:59] <triveni> should i ignore it
[09/25 09:00] <triveni> or is it important to join
[09/25 09:00] <06Amit_ZOS> Triveni!! How's your recovery coming along??????

[09/25 09:02] <triveni> hahahha
[09/25 09:02] <dsk_hbe> that was aimed at the stupid phone call... just making sure you knew that ;-)
[09/25 09:03] <JimE_zOS> I resemble that remark! 
[09/25 09:03] <dsk_hbe> this may break Skype... coudl be fun
[09/25 09:04] <02charlie> 171 participants now

[09/25 09:04] <JimE_zOS> I can't use skype.  The "S" button on my keyboard won't work. 
[09/25 09:04] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/25 09:04] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 09:04] <JimE_zOS> and I'm not in a session 
[09/25 09:04] <02charlie> we have a hacker leading us :)
[09/25 09:04] <JimE_zOS> innovation day session, that is. 
[09/25 09:05] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah, Chris H. 
[09/25 09:05] <02charlie> no, he just doesnt have his phone muted 
[09/25 09:06] <triveni> i joined too.
[09/25 09:09] <02charlie> hmm, maybe he is the presenter
[09/25 09:14] <dsk_hbe> um, no lunch for me ;-)  hey that's ok ;-)
[09/25 09:15] <02charlie> yeah, they didnt arrange for my lunch either
[09/25 09:16] <06Amit_ZOS> Well i didnt know they will give out lunch!
[09/25 09:16] <02charlie> or you would have been back on campus? ;)
[09/25 09:16] <dsk_hbe> you can drive here, amit... I'll feed you ;-)
[09/25 09:17] <06Amit_ZOS> lol... I might just take you up on that! plus think of all the miles!
[09/25 09:17] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 09:17] <06Amit_ZOS> ;-)
[09/25 09:17] <dsk_hbe> exactly ;-)
[09/25 09:21] <JimE_zOS> I'm going to claim that I have already innovated and not go at all. 
[09/25 09:23] <02charlie> 69 abends on that doc in DW yesterday, most of them after i created the sev 1 for that doc
[09/25 09:24] <02charlie> they never cease to amaze me
[09/25 09:25] <dsk_hbe> I am schedueld with people in St. Louis this year, I think... it will be interesting to see if we have anything in common to come up with something... I may just encourage them to go on their own ideas and I'll just sit by ;-)
[09/25 09:26] <02charlie> oh, and O's fall break is oct 18-20, so i'll probably be taking those as pto. and my wife tells me the christmas break does not start dec 12, so i need to check with O when he gets back from school to see when it actually is 
[09/25 09:27] <dsk_hbe> could you send me anote when you are sure of dates, Charlie?  so I have it all in one place for oncall drafting
[09/25 09:27] <06Amit_ZOS> oh is that in a mail ? (to see who i am scheduled with?)
[09/25 09:27] <02charlie> yes, ma'am
[09/25 09:28] <dsk_hbe> no, I haven't even started it yet ;-)
[09/25 09:29] <06Amit_ZOS> no no.. i meant the innovation day teaming up
[09/25 09:29] <dsk_hbe> oh!
[09/25 09:29] <dsk_hbe> if you got a meeting notice, go to that and then hit the 'scheduling assistant' link and it will show you who is in your group
[09/25 09:31] <dsk_hbe> Mike Linder is the only name I know on your group
[09/25 09:34] <triveni> they exempted me for this time. I ll listen ur feedbacks this time and will join it next year. :)
[09/25 09:34] <dsk_hbe> no fair! ;-)
[09/25 09:35] <triveni> am not sure how many times a year this happens? i ll join the next one ;)
[09/25 09:35] <dsk_hbe> just once a year, thankfully
[09/25 09:35] <triveni> hahaha. that's good
[09/25 09:39] <JimE_zOS> I don't know why, but I'm really not scheduled into a session. 
[09/25 09:39] <dsk_hbe> NO FAIR!
[09/25 09:39] <dsk_hbe> so jeal;ous ;-)
[09/25 09:39] <JimE_zOS> tell Mike I said "howdy" :-)
[09/25 09:40] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/25 09:41] <02charlie> yu probably didnt reply to the invitation
[09/25 09:42] <JimE_zOS> certainly possible. 
[09/25 09:42] <06Amit_ZOS> I did not find the scheduling assistant but i did find a mail from what looks like my innovation day team
[09/25 09:42] <triveni> hehehe
[09/25 09:43] <06Amit_ZOS> Mike Linder is in my team
[09/25 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> oh you said that already..
[09/25 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> pfft.. tubelight
[09/25 09:44] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/25 09:44] <06Amit_ZOS> i thought you were talking about your team
[09/25 09:45] <dsk_hbe> no, I have JillS... yay (not)
[09/25 09:45] <06Amit_ZOS> and yes Jim, I will tell him howdy!
[09/25 09:46] <JimE_zOS> I'm checking over OPC dependencies for the changes I made...more than I ever remember making.  
[09/25 09:50] <triveni> will there be a winning team
[09/25 09:51] <triveni> i ll clap.. :) my hands are fully functional. I would like to use them to support my teammates ;)
[09/25 09:51] <02charlie> dont ever allow friday to be the peak hour?
[09/25 09:51] <02charlie> ???
[09/25 09:51] <dsk_hbe> for innovation days? there are no winners ;-)
[09/25 09:51] <dsk_hbe> personal opinion ;-)
[09/25 09:51] <triveni> ohk
[09/25 09:52] <triveni> personal opinion.. hmm.. interesting.. so m cheering for everyone now ;)
[09/25 09:52] <dsk_hbe> cheer for our survival ;-)  Sorry, sarcastic oncaller mode is on big time ;-)
[09/25 09:53] <triveni> hhahaah 
[09/25 09:56] <02charlie> lol @ randy's comment
[09/25 09:57] <dsk_hbe> I love him ;-)
[09/25 09:57] <02charlie> randy said the systems we were running 2 bg copies were as busy as the ones running 3, and ivan just suggested shutting another bg copy down
[09/25 09:58] <02charlie> sounds like what you were doing jim
[09/25 09:59] <dsk_hbe> I vote no on that unless forced... our load is ridiculous :-/
[09/25 10:00] <02charlie> brb
[09/25 10:03] <JimE_zOS> I can't understand why we don't understand that our customers need to run complex searches.  At one point, pig searches came from losers.  Now complex searches come from just about everybody. 
[09/25 10:04] <JimE_zOS> and to slow that down is to deny the evolution of our customers and to risk becoming irrelevant as a service. 
[09/25 10:05] <dsk_hbe> EXACTLY!!!!
[09/25 10:05] <dsk_hbe> some days this place just drives me crazy.
[09/25 10:06] <dsk_hbe> they need to think about where we'd be if not for all the amazing tuning changes Vickie and Wayne have made... without the negative news processing... man, we'd be irrelevant already... ditto the abuser processing.
[09/25 10:07] <JimE_zOS> not enough, I guess.  They want to continue to think about searches the way we did 20 decades ago. 
[09/25 10:07] <dsk_hbe> but what really drives me nuts is when they have these kinds of conversations in a setting like this... a bunch of people who don't really work in these stats listening to a bunch of opinions and guesses... it really is otu of place
[09/25 10:13] <02charlie> i's like to see what la does with those complex searches
[09/25 10:18] <02charlie> debbie, what do the numbers in the cells with the uids mean?
[09/25 10:21] <dsk_hbe> those are total CPU used by the day all day in milliseconds
[09/25 10:22] <dsk_hbe> so on Wednesday, our pig used 71,848.991 seconds of CPU
[09/25 10:23] <02charlie> just what i was going to ask
[09/25 10:23] <02charlie> thx
[09/25 10:23] <dsk_hbe> sure.
[09/25 10:23] <02charlie> that's a lot of cpu
[09/25 10:24] <dsk_hbe> and on the FG list, the Diligence healthcheck ID is my barometer... 8fhh7f... his numbers are pretty close to the same every day... it's when I see someone showing up above him that I poke into their usage.
[09/25 10:24] <02charlie> 19.96 hours of CPU time???
[09/25 10:24] <02charlie> sheesh
[09/25 10:25] <dsk_hbe> it's crazy... sure hope Vickie's changes cut into that significantly
[09/25 10:37] <02charlie> looking like rain and i'm hearing thunkder
[09/25 10:37] <02charlie> which is like thunder, only with more thunk in it :)
[09/25 10:40] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/25 10:41] <JimE_zOS> I just assumed that was the German spelling. :-)
[09/25 10:41] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 10:43] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[09/25 10:43] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[09/25 10:46] <02charlie> that was definiately thunkder :)
[09/25 10:47] <02charlie> (a definite THUNK there)
[09/25 11:23] * Amit_away is now known as Amit_zOS
[09/25 11:53] <JimE_zOS> I think I"m going to step away and try to wake up.  Maybe get some lunch 
[09/25 11:53] <02charlie> sounds like a good plan
[09/25 11:54] <JimE_zOS> and to be clear, I'm your bridge buddy. 
[09/25 11:55] <06Amit_zOS> as always!
[09/25 11:56] <06Amit_zOS> 2am buddy in other words
[09/25 11:58] <dsk_hbe> like I'd call anyone else ;-)
[09/25 11:58] <dsk_hbe> I mean no offense to the rest of you... but... ;-)
[09/25 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> even if you'd call anyone else, i think the chain will eventually end with Jim
[09/25 12:01] <06Amit_zOS> ;-)
[09/25 12:01] <02charlie> no offense taken, btw :D
[09/25 12:02] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/25 12:17] <02charlie> if i cant find my dataset in dms, it doesnt exist anywhere anymore, correct?
[09/25 12:18] <dsk_hbe> that'd be my guess yeah... it's a personal charlie named dataset?
[09/25 12:19] <02charlie> yeah, i have fabc and prod anaylsis datasets back to 1/1, but the DV ones only go back to 2/25
[09/25 12:19] <02charlie> i think i didnt run the long term analysis on that set frequently enough
[09/25 12:19] <dsk_hbe> then I think you're outta luck... there are some datasets, like dumps, that Jim does that fancy combining of, but sounds like this isn't somethign like that
[09/25 12:19] <02charlie> as my mom would say, oh well!
[09/25 12:20] <02charlie> no, that wouldnt be one of them
[09/25 12:34] <dsk_hbe> "Your teephone link to LEXIS-NEXIS will now be disconnected"... ah, the old days... can't say I miss slow phone connections though!
[09/25 12:34] <02charlie> :)
[09/25 12:52] <dsk_hbe> Trying to apply these updates before rebooting... boy are they taking forever
[09/25 12:56] <dsk_hbe> finally... rebooting... brb
[09/25 12:56] * dsk_hbe has quit IRC (Quit: )
[09/25 13:05] * dsk_hbe has joined #theRock
[09/25 13:05] <dsk_hbe> that took forever
[09/25 13:21] <JimE_zOS> back 
[09/25 13:21] <JimE_zOS> and yes, I was gone forever. 
[09/25 13:21] <JimE_zOS> sorry 
[09/25 13:21] <02charlie> i dont think debbie was talking about you :)
[09/25 13:21] <dsk_hbe> I doubt we will ever repay you the hours you have over worked... silly apology ;-)
[09/25 13:24] <JimE_zOS> the shower cleared my head so I should share some things, high level, for general awareness. 
[09/25 13:24] <JimE_zOS> 1) CRIT and COLD now run automatically 
[09/25 13:25] <JimE_zOS> 2) I wrote a proces to ensure copies (prod mode) are down before allowing things in CRIT to fire. 
[09/25 13:25] <JimE_zOS> 3) lots of OPC dependency changes around this one...cause I moved the control point lower in the applications (after my "are copies down" process)
[09/25 13:26] <JimE_zOS> 4) SR's move to bridge at 22:00, LCRE down at 22:30 and SA/LFD bridge starts at 23:00 
[09/25 13:28] <JimE_zOS> done to avoid (for SRs) master dictionary updates and to be up before LCRE comes down; done to avoid (for SA/LFD) the LCRE=OFF modify   
[09/25 13:28] <JimE_zOS> 5) bridge starts in whatever mode we are already in.  Normally PULB, but I just copy/match the LCF. 
[09/25 13:29] <JimE_zOS> 6) at 01:45, I have an application that moves us to PUSH and makes the OPC promote special resources unavailable. 
[09/25 13:29] <JimE_zOS> (PUSH right at 01:45, resources at 01:55) 
[09/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> the PUSH auto-tickets are proof that this part is working :-)
[09/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> (and, yes, I have a plan to address) 
[09/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> OPS is aware and I'll remind Sherry tongith after 6pm. 
[09/25 13:30] <JimE_zOS> after CRIT and COLD auto-run, the copies will auto-start 
[09/25 13:31] <JimE_zOS> SA/PCS copies first 
[09/25 13:31] <JimE_zOS> the SR's transition too.
[09/25 13:31] <JimE_zOS> the LFD copies wait for all of the above to be done. 
[09/25 13:31] <triveni> interesting info 
[09/25 13:32] <JimE_zOS> BECAUSE, when you do that all at once, one LFD copy gets confused and issues a non-stop stream of "not availble to all SR copies" messages. 
[09/25 13:32] <JimE_zOS> and once that copy is found (simple diary check) and bounced, all better 
[09/25 13:32] <triveni> ok
[09/25 13:33] <JimE_zOS> so last night I tried to keep the simulataneous fireworks to a dull roar in the hopes of not tweaking LFD. 
[09/25 13:33] <JimE_zOS> and, no issues 
[09/25 13:33] <02charlie> excellent
[09/25 13:33] <JimE_zOS> we'll come back to that one later 
[09/25 13:34] <02charlie> how is any of this affected by am MVS release (or is that something we'll come back to later)?
[09/25 13:34] <JimE_zOS> once SA/PCS, SR and LFD are all in prod mode, I move us to PULB, repoint the batch LCF alias to the prod LCF and turn on the OPC promote S/Rs 
[09/25 13:34] <JimE_zOS> MVS release...later, please. 
[09/25 13:34] <02charlie> ok
[09/25 13:34] <JimE_zOS> needs attention, but I'm not ready for that yet. 
[09/25 13:35] <06Amit_zOS> cool
[09/25 13:35] <JimE_zOS> I do have a plan, of course. 
[09/25 13:35] <02charlie> :)
[09/25 13:35] <JimE_zOS> so it isn't like I'm pacing in front of a whiteboard with nothing. 
[09/25 13:35] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 13:35] <JimE_zOS> although the copy checker didn't exist at midnight last night, and by 02:00, it was ready 
[09/25 13:36] <JimE_zOS> I do have some enhancements I want to make to that code. 
[09/25 13:36] <JimE_zOS> but it works. 
[09/25 13:36] <JimE_zOS> I have reduced the webI configurations to 4 
[09/25 13:37] <02charlie> nice
[09/25 13:37] <JimE_zOS> we are running "daytime" right now.  At 22:00, 22:30 and 23:00 we'll change webI config files. 
[09/25 13:38] <JimE_zOS> and go back to "daytime", I after COLD finishes 
[09/25 13:38] <JimE_zOS> I've also added comments at the top of the remaining webI files to tell you the delta from the previous file 
[09/25 13:39] <JimE_zOS> LFD start-up PROCS completely reworked. 
[09/25 13:39] <JimE_zOS> LFD now using COPY$CHK (not COPY$CTL) 
[09/25 13:39] <JimE_zOS> COPY$CHK ensures that OPS doesn't start copies on the wrong systems and very little else. 
[09/25 13:40] <JimE_zOS> with this process, the timers and clock restrictions are all gone. 
[09/25 13:40] <JimE_zOS> I'd like to spend time changing the SA start-up PROCS, but that'll have to next time. 
[09/25 13:41] <JimE_zOS> I did change the SA PROCs to use COPY$CHK too. 
[09/25 13:41] <JimE_zOS> no change to the PCS PROCs at all. 
[09/25 13:41] <JimE_zOS> all of the old SE00CB* bridge apps are gone EXECPT the bridge SOD and bridge EOD. 
[09/25 13:41] <JimE_zOS> but all of the old bridge start task apps, gone. 
[09/25 13:42] <JimE_zOS> teh wave application, gone. 
[09/25 13:42] <JimE_zOS> when we start copies after COLD, we come up in a our full daytime configuration. 
[09/25 13:43] <JimE_zOS> all of these apps are SE00OLSCFG@* applications. 
[09/25 13:43] <JimE_zOS> and, specifically, if you look for SE00OLSCFG@*X, (which marks the spot) you'll find most of them. 
[09/25 13:43] <02charlie> Application                                 Input arrival   S   P  G
[09/25 13:43] <02charlie> id                text                      date     time           
[09/25 13:43] <02charlie> SE00CBRIDGESOD    OLS Bridge Start of Day   17/09/25 15.00  W   9  N
[09/25 13:43] <02charlie> SE00CBRIDGEEOD    OLS Bridge End of Day     17/09/26 02.00  W   9  N
[09/25 13:43] <JimE_zOS> right....like I said, those survived. 
[09/25 13:44] <02charlie> yes
[09/25 13:44] <JimE_zOS> at SOD, I needed more than a single application, so I had to branch out from "X"
[09/25 13:44] <02charlie> i see that
[09/25 13:45] <JimE_zOS> so you'll also find "W", "Y" and "Z" bridge to prod apps 
[09/25 13:45] <JimE_zOS> I do think the DW mess was a dependency problem.  
[09/25 13:46] <JimE_zOS> I believe I've corrected that. 
[09/25 13:46] <JimE_zOS> oh, oh....my automatino does NOT start PCS or SA HCP
[09/25 13:46] <JimE_zOS> which OPS also knows. 
[09/25 13:46] <JimE_zOS> they started HCP for me this morning. 
[09/25 13:46] <JimE_zOS> I'll add that, of course, but it isn't there now. 
[09/25 13:47] <02charlie> i thought you had added the PCS start
[09/25 13:47] <JimE_zOS> yes, PCS start. 
[09/25 13:47] <JimE_zOS> but that isn't the same thing as starting HCP
[09/25 13:47] <02charlie> right
[09/25 13:47] <JimE_zOS> starting the copy that runs HCP isn't enough. 
[09/25 13:48] <02charlie> theres a modify command to start hcp, right?
[09/25 13:48] <JimE_zOS> yep.
[09/25 13:48] <JimE_zOS> two, actually 
[09/25 13:48] <JimE_zOS> a bridge too far 
[09/25 13:48] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 13:48] <02charlie> nice reference :)
[09/25 13:49] <JimE_zOS> when you are writing autoCRIT two hours before it runs for the first time, you leave modify commands to OPS a little longer. 
[09/25 13:49] <02charlie> well, at least it wasnt 30 seconds before this time :)
[09/25 13:50] <JimE_zOS> adding an F-Card rename, sure. 
[09/25 13:50] <JimE_zOS> running code before teh electrons cool, not too smart. 
[09/25 13:50] <02charlie> rotflmao
[09/25 13:50] <JimE_zOS> speaking of F-Cards, changes there too. 
[09/25 13:51] <JimE_zOS> (remind me to talk about LFD Cluster 9) 
[09/25 13:51] <JimE_zOS> since we are reusing Cluster 8 as both prod and bridge, the J-Cards aren't what I needed. 
[09/25 13:52] <JimE_zOS> so, there a JCOPY8x member where we have full connectivity to LCRE and "appropriate" connectivity to psc1828 and psc2828 
[09/25 13:53] <JimE_zOS> and a BJCOPY8x member where we drop LCRE connections (well, set to "M") and allow just a little more access for psc1828 and 2828. 
[09/25 13:53] <JimE_zOS> I'll replace the duplicated members (BJCOPY*) with something I auto-generate when we run F-Cards but that code it just a doodle on a flip chart 
[09/25 13:54] <JimE_zOS> for now, what we have will be fine. 
[09/25 13:54] <JimE_zOS> Cluster 9....
[09/25 13:54] <JimE_zOS> since we don't even start cluster 9 copies, CRIT hates me. 
[09/25 13:54] <JimE_zOS> when CRIT runs and finds that no copies in the cluster were started for the day, he abends. 
[09/25 13:55] <JimE_zOS> kind of annoying. 
[09/25 13:55] <JimE_zOS> so my temp fix is to start a cluster 9 copy long enough to get a start-up complete message and then I FDQUIESCE the thing. 
[09/25 13:55] <JimE_zOS> problem avoided. 
[09/25 13:56] <02charlie> it works :)
[09/25 13:56] <JimE_zOS> yeah, not thrilled 
[09/25 13:56] <JimE_zOS> but I hate to take cluster 9 apart. 
[09/25 13:56] <02charlie> yeah, but good enuff for govt work
[09/25 13:56] <JimE_zOS> we may get tehre, but I'm not in a hurry. 
[09/25 13:56] <JimE_zOS> and I might find a new use for Cluster 9 
[09/25 13:57] <JimE_zOS> maybe use it to distract Mr. Anderson. :-)
[09/25 13:57] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 13:58] <JimE_zOS> I made changes this morning (after the run and DW clean-up) to make things a little faster. 
[09/25 13:58] <JimE_zOS> I let SAP06G come up all my himself. 
[09/25 13:58] <JimE_zOS> and SAP03G too, for that matter 
[09/25 13:58] <JimE_zOS> ditto for PCS 5 and then PCS 6 
[09/25 13:59] <JimE_zOS> after that, I let SA and PCS starts run in parallel. 
[09/25 13:59] <JimE_zOS> for LFD I start with SYSA and SYSJ.. 
[09/25 14:00] <JimE_zOS> when SYSA completes, SYSC will take its place. 
[09/25 14:00] <JimE_zOS> when SYSJ completes, SYSG stuff will run. 
[09/25 14:00] <JimE_zOS> that keeps the WSK copies up and running during the transition. 
[09/25 14:01] <JimE_zOS> and it prevents a "little" system (like SYSA) from yeilding to SYSG. 
[09/25 14:03] <JimE_zOS> I have to follow-up with Wayne on an issue I encountered.  The LVT abend counts don't seem to be updated in the SA copies. 
[09/25 14:03] <JimE_zOS> which makes starting them harder cause I can't tell when they actually take on work. 
[09/25 14:03] <JimE_zOS> (or are ready to take on work) 
[09/25 14:04] <02charlie> what's your workaround for that?
[09/25 14:04] <JimE_zOS> hardcoded sleep for the SA copies after teh start command is issued 
[09/25 14:04] <02charlie> ah
[09/25 14:04] <JimE_zOS> ditto for PCS since he doesn't even have an LVT
[09/25 14:04] <02charlie> yeah
[09/25 14:05] <JimE_zOS> keep in mind that it isn't possible to be more inconsistant than OPS has been over teh years. 
[09/25 14:05] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 14:05] <JimE_zOS> at least I wait for COLD to complete before I start. 
[09/25 14:05] <02charlie> rotflmao
[09/25 14:06] <JimE_zOS> you laugh, but when OPS calls you at 02:07 and tells you that they started a copy before COLD was done, it is life shortening. 
[09/25 14:06] <02charlie> yeah
[09/25 14:06] <JimE_zOS> there was a team who used to race start-up to see if they could beat the other shift
[09/25 14:06] <JimE_zOS> not a fan 
[09/25 14:07] <02charlie> *sigh*
[09/25 14:07] <JimE_zOS> anyway, I think those are the hilites 
[09/25 14:08] <JimE_zOS> I have more things to do and enhancements to make, but this is usable. 
[09/25 14:08] <02charlie> well, let me know what i'll need to do for the MVS release on 10/8, and then again for the BCP on 10/14
[09/25 14:09] <JimE_zOS> right...sure 
[09/25 14:09] <JimE_zOS> actually, for BCP, just add the prod mode apps. 
[09/25 14:09] <dsk_hbe> anyone know what NDC means in our little wold?
[09/25 14:09] <JimE_zOS> nexis dot com ? 
[09/25 14:09] <02charlie> that would be my guess too debbie
[09/25 14:09] <dsk_hbe> smack... ok, to quote you, Jim... no fcards for me ;-)
[09/25 14:10] <02charlie> unless its network device controller
[09/25 14:10] <dsk_hbe> I can't remember anyone ever calling Nexis that, but thanks ;-)

[09/25 14:13] <02charlie> i'll stop now :)
[09/25 14:16] <06Amit_zOS> thats a tall list of Enhancements Jim! scratched my head for a bit
[09/25 14:16] <02charlie> it is a good list, runs very nicely too
[09/25 14:17] <JimE_zOS> things could be better...faster
[09/25 14:17] <JimE_zOS> I'd like to understand my LFD freaks out 
[09/25 14:17] <JimE_zOS> e /my/why/ 
[09/25 14:18] <JimE_zOS> I need to work around IPLs
[09/25 14:18] <JimE_zOS> some parts of the process could be more self correcting. 
[09/25 14:19] <02charlie> are promotions running around the LFDs?
[09/25 14:19] <JimE_zOS> nope....not until everybody is back in prod mode. 
[09/25 14:19] <JimE_zOS> can't do promotes during the bridge window AFTER the SA copies go down. 
[09/25 14:20] <JimE_zOS> I'm guessing that there is just too much inventory information for LFD to process during his own start-up

[09/25 15:21] <06Amit_ZOS> internet issues
[09/25 15:21] <dsk_hbe> did you enjoy innovating today, Amit?
[09/25 15:22] <02charlie> lol
[09/25 15:22] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. i did not really participate..
[09/25 15:22] <06Amit_ZOS> had no clue what to do
[09/25 15:22] <02charlie> join the group :D
[09/25 15:23] <06Amit_ZOS> my uncle called and changed internet connections in the last half hour
[09/25 15:23] <06Amit_ZOS> I don't see a group to join.. maybe there was a conference call that i missed
[09/25 15:23] <dsk_hbe> last year I was in a dinky group... it took us the majority of the time we were meeting to decide what we might have in common even to propose something on.  I suspect that is why so many teams chose service now/webstar issues
[09/25 15:40] <02charlie> oh, that's right, thursday they're doing the firewall changes again
[09/25 15:41] <02charlie> starts at 0600 thru 1800
[09/25 15:41] <02charlie> lovely
[09/25 15:42] <triveni> i ll start my physiotherapy excercise. Bye everyone!!
[09/25 15:42] <06Amit_ZOS> Bye! :)
[09/25 15:42] * triveni is now known as triveni_away
[09/25 15:42] <02charlie> bye triveni
[09/25 15:42] <dsk_hbe> bye Triveni!
[09/25 15:56] <02charlie> i wonder if this might have been the cause:
[09/25 15:56] <02charlie> # 154828 K041 IDXLOD/311W: DB:0570 GEN:3049 was renamed. Will Mark Unusable.
[09/25 15:56] <02charlie> # 154828 K041 IDXLOD/311W: stat() of directory failed. errno:2
[09/25 15:56] <02charlie> more stuff, then
[09/25 15:56] <02charlie> @ 154903 K041 CRECPQ/715A: statsThread generated SIGSEGV signal (sig:11). Abort.
[09/25 15:57] <dsk_hbe> I saw that, could very well be... ugly way to acknowledge that though... which is likely one of many reasons we still don't let them do that in prod whenever they darn well please!
[09/25 15:57] <02charlie> yeah :)
[09/25 15:57] <dsk_hbe> sicne it created an ugly core especially
[09/25 15:58] <02charlie> yeah, i'm not going to look at the core right now, we're almost at the lcrecheck run and i dont want to generate error emails and cause the app to fail unnecessarily
[09/25 16:01] <dsk_hbe> I am going to head away for now.  Have a good night all!
[09/25 16:01] <02charlie> G&Q nite debbie
[09/25 16:02] <06Amit_ZOS> Gnight all! :)
[09/25 16:03] <02charlie> and now that i've looked at the core, i am more convinced than ever it was the result of the new stylesheet db coming online
[09/25 16:04] <02charlie> and now i'm outta here too, g&q nite all

[09/26 08:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Good morning Debbie! :)
[09/26 08:38] <02charlie> i see they didnt heed by warning not to put the doc online until they fixed it, as we had a bunch of CREXDD abends yesterday in prod, but on gens before they fixed the doc
[09/26 08:38] * charlie shakes head
[09/26 08:38] <06Amit_ZOS> ah ok
[09/26 08:38] <triveni> gm debbie
[09/26 09:06] <02charlie> sheesh. 101 CREXDD abends in DW for that doc, all the way up thru gen 1494. so they had, yesterday, done gens 1492, 1493, and 1494, all with the bad doc, until they finally fixed it with gen 1495
[09/26 09:06] <02charlie> and we had a bunch of abends in prod with thompson hine on that same doc

[09/26 09:31] <dsk_hbe> hiya Jim
[09/26 09:32] <02charlie> early again, considering your night/morning
[09/26 09:32] <JimE_zOS> here for a concall with Kerri B RE: SOD/EOD 
[09/26 09:32] <02charlie> ah
[09/26 09:32] <JimE_zOS> I'm bionic.  Shhhhh...don't tell anyone. :-)
[09/26 09:32] <triveni> whatsup Jim ;)
[09/26 09:32] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 09:32] <JimE_zOS> T! 
[09/26 09:32] <triveni> eheheh
[09/26 09:33] <triveni> I am learning to use my bionic powers :D
[09/26 09:33] <JimE_zOS> good, good.  I'm just a tired old man.  Nothing bionic here at all. 
[09/26 09:33] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/26 09:33] <triveni> hahaha
[09/26 09:34] <06Amit_ZOS> Hey Jim!
[09/26 09:34] <JimE_zOS> GM, all! 
[09/26 09:34] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, I don't plan to watch EOD/SOD tonight. 
[09/26 09:34] <dsk_hbe> cool!
[09/26 09:34] <JimE_zOS> happy to respond to a page from any of you or OPS, but I'm not going to watch 
[09/26 09:35] <dsk_hbe> thanks Jim!
[09/26 09:35] <JimE_zOS> also, I've addressed the automated start-up of Cluster 9 copies. 
[09/26 09:35] <JimE_zOS> and the HCP start for SA is now automated. 
[09/26 09:35] <JimE_zOS> so the only thing OPS has to do is start PCS HCP. 
[09/26 09:35] <JimE_zOS> that and not page us when we go to PUSH 
[09/26 09:36] <JimE_zOS> that has been discussed at length 
[09/26 09:37] <triveni> i need clapping emoji..yey.
[09/26 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> like today morning you mean
[09/26 09:37] <06Amit_ZOS> (the page)
[09/26 09:37] <02charlie> i dont think that ticket got paged
[09/26 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> wasnt it a p1?
[09/26 09:38] <02charlie> didnt get paged
[09/26 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> ok
[09/26 09:38] <02charlie> its an autoticket, but ops did nt page it
[09/26 09:38] <06Amit_ZOS> cool
[09/26 09:39] <02charlie> when don and scott can get to it, they will probably stop the autoticket
[09/26 09:41] <02charlie> im going to go thru the password change exercise, since i dont want to have to do it next week 
[09/26 09:44] <dsk_hbe> Durkin has validated that it's not me failing to type my password 50 times... there is an issue with my ID and TA boxes, particularly psc2827.  So Dean can suck it... ahem... shhh... I dind't say that ;-)
[09/26 09:51] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 09:51] <02charlie> btw, dr and innovation days are both at the same time, which meeting should i attend? :)
[09/26 09:53] <02charlie> i need to get comfortable before my meetings, brb
[09/26 10:27] <JimE_zOS> "back" from concall 
[09/26 10:50] <02charlie> i had a question for you, but innovation has driven it from my mind :\
[09/26 10:51] <dsk_hbe> ugh... 9 minutes until mine... can't wait :-p
[09/26 10:52] <02charlie> :)
[09/26 10:56] <dsk_hbe> ok, tea for caffeine, some cheese for protein, and some candy corn because I have to reward myself for attending somehow ;-)
[09/26 10:56] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 10:56] <02charlie> candy corn and salted peanuts
[09/26 10:57] <02charlie> you'd get your protein that way :)
[09/26 10:57] <02charlie> you might not be able to stop eating it, th :)

[09/26 11:29] <02charlie> lol

[09/26 11:58] <JimE_zOS> no, Triveni, you are "T", not "B" :-)
[09/26 11:58] <02charlie> :D
[09/26 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> i had the most difficult time pronouncing 'pecan' to the lady at starbuck in cali
[09/26 11:59] <06Amit_ZOS> i never knew how to pronounce it
[09/26 12:00] <02charlie> pea-can or pea-conn
[09/26 12:00] <02charlie> need to reboot
[09/26 12:00] <JimE_zOS> pea-conn
[09/26 12:01] <JimE_zOS> no choice.  only one correct answer. 
[09/26 12:01] <02charlie> in the south, pea-can
[09/26 12:01] <JimE_zOS> no choice.  only one correct answer. 
[09/26 12:01] <02charlie> lol

[09/26 12:07] <dsk_hbe> catching up - unshelled :-)
[09/26 12:08] <02charlie> :)
[09/26 12:08] <dsk_hbe> and salted... important fact for you ;-)
[09/26 12:08] <02charlie> yes, indeed :D
[09/26 12:08] <02charlie> it's the only way :D
[09/26 12:09] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/26 12:09] <02charlie> all devices using the new password have been rebooted, so hopefully i'm back in sync
[09/26 12:10] <dsk_hbe> we're on a short lunch break... all my snacks are gone... I'm hoping they finish up quickly when we rejoin!

[09/26 12:10] <JimE_zOS> you know it. 
[09/26 12:10] <JimE_zOS> but I'll filter :-)
[09/26 12:15] <JimE_zOS> Kerri B sent me the OPS doc on lexis startup, bridging, etc. 
[09/26 12:15] <JimE_zOS> so I could update it. 
[09/26 12:16] <JimE_zOS> this multi-page doc can pretty much be replaced with "Sit down and don't touch anything." 
[09/26 12:16] <dsk_hbe> I bet that was eye opening ;-)
[09/26 12:16] <dsk_hbe> LOL!
[09/26 12:16] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 12:16] <JimE_zOS> I'll share...sec 
[09/26 12:17] <02charlie> i know my question now, is the ipl prep application only visible to you and U#OLMR1 in out team?
[09/26 12:19] <JimE_zOS> yes. 
[09/26 12:19] <JimE_zOS> OPC IDs can all see everything. 
[09/26 12:20] <JimE_zOS> but Doug had to grant me access to the IPL Prep application owner code. 
[09/26 12:22] <02charlie> so U#OLMR1 can see all OPC applications?
[09/26 12:22] <JimE_zOS> I think so.  Never really put that to the test 
[09/26 12:23] <JimE_zOS> why do you ask? 
[09/26 12:33] <02charlie> hmm, i sorry, innovation distracting me
[09/26 12:34] <02charlie> i thought i had an issue with U#OLMR1 seeing some of RD's apps
[09/26 12:34] <02charlie> sec
[09/26 12:37] <JimE_zOS> good.  I sure don't want any cross talk there. 
[09/26 12:38] <JimE_zOS> the last thing we need is some process reaching out and goofing CRIT/COLD/BRige and causing a total center outage. 
[09/26 12:38] <02charlie> true
[09/26 12:38] <JimE_zOS> do we have an app that looks for RD stuff? 
[09/26 12:39] <02charlie> this looks for C1 apps: PT00.OPCA.PSQA.JCLLIB(E98C1CHK)
[09/26 12:40] <02charlie> that's run under one of RD's applications
[09/26 12:40] <JimE_zOS> but that runs under the U#PSQA1 ID, right?  
[09/26 12:40] <02charlie> im sure it does
[09/26 12:50] <02charlie> E98C1IRC launches under U#OLMR1 out of my application and looks for our C1 applications
[09/26 12:52] <JimE_zOS> oh, right....the CTL app/jobs. 
[09/26 12:54] <06Amit_ZOS> brb
[09/26 12:55] <dsk_hbe> done...yay!
[09/26 12:55] <JimE_zOS> and what was your team's idea? 
[09/26 12:56] <02charlie> jealous
[09/26 12:56] <02charlie> still innovating 
[09/26 12:56] <dsk_hbe> basically to get LA to play nice with ITIL.  Jill and Dave Lunning's idea.
[09/26 12:56] <JimE_zOS> manufacture extra ice and drop it from planes to thwart global warming? :-)
[09/26 12:56] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 12:56] <dsk_hbe> what a great idea!
[09/26 12:57] <JimE_zOS> could be made to help with droughts too. 
[09/26 12:57] <JimE_zOS> we'd have to rename some things.  Death Valley would be more like "Uncomfortable Valley" 
[09/26 12:58] <dsk_hbe> ;-D
[09/26 12:58] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 12:58] <02charlie> you're distracting me from innovating :)
[09/26 12:59] <JimE_zOS> I just innovate.  Don't need a meeting or a day to do so. 
[09/26 13:00] <06Amit_ZOS> lol..
[09/26 13:01] <JimE_zOS> the stream of Mozart and coffee do help. 
[09/26 13:01] <02charlie> :D
[09/26 13:02] <dsk_hbe> does everyone but me know that DevOps is referrign to cloud-based apps?  I had no idea and it sure isn't intuitive in the name.
[09/26 13:02] <02charlie> i didnt think devops was limited t cloud-based apps
[09/26 13:03] <dsk_hbe> apparently it is... at least according to Jill and Dave
[09/26 13:03] <06Amit_ZOS> reffering where?
[09/26 13:03] <JimE_zOS> let me check:  JRE+1A8 = '00'.  Nope...I didn't know. :-)
[09/26 13:03] <dsk_hbe> LOL
[09/26 13:03] <dsk_hbe> just part of the topic of our innovation talk, Amit
[09/26 13:04] <06Amit_ZOS> are you and charlie in the same team!?
[09/26 13:04] <02charlie> no
[09/26 13:05] <dsk_hbe> no... we're done and he's not ;-)
[09/26 13:05] <02charlie> still innovating 
[09/26 13:05] <06Amit_ZOS> i suppose not since you finished and charlie has not
[09/26 13:05] <06Amit_ZOS> jinx
[09/26 13:05] <02charlie> jinx!
[09/26 13:05] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/26 13:05] <02charlie> double jinx!
[09/26 13:05] <dsk_hbe> not that I'm rubbing it in or anythign ;-)
[09/26 13:05] <02charlie> triple dog dare!
[09/26 13:05] <02charlie> :)
[09/26 13:12] <02charlie> back to my security violations, it didnt help i mis-typed the password in my password change job
[09/26 13:12] <JimE_zOS> sure
[09/26 13:13] <02charlie> and despite rebooting all the devices after changing all my passwords, outhouse, skype and onedrive all wanted me to re-enter credentials
[09/26 13:27] <dsk_hbe> sgrrr... can someone remind me what those emails look like that ask you to change your unix passwords?
[09/26 13:27] <dsk_hbe> I know I did it recently but can't find one of the emails to save my life
[09/26 13:27] <02charlie> you wan tyhe url?
[09/26 13:28] <dsk_hbe> no I want the subject line or some such from the email so I can find one
[09/26 13:28] <02charlie> mine are long gone
[09/26 13:28] <JimE_zOS> accout will expire in xx days. 
[09/26 13:28] <JimE_zOS> yeah, I don't have any either. 
[09/26 13:28] <02charlie> i just use the url i've saved: https://use-security.lexisnexis.com/password_change/
[09/26 13:28] <JimE_zOS> going from memory 
[09/26 13:28] <triveni> UNIX olscert domain 
[09/26 13:28] <triveni> search this in emails
[09/26 13:28] <triveni> or olsprod
[09/26 13:29] <dsk_hbe> I'm tryign to determine when it was that I changed my password exactly... so knowing what is in the email will show me when I received the last one so I can pinpoint that date
[09/26 13:29] <06Amit_ZOS> 'Your LEGAL Network Password will soon expire. See attached link for instructions.'
[09/26 13:29] <dsk_hbe> so no link... just email
[09/26 13:29] <02charlie> ah
[09/26 13:29] <dsk_hbe> not the legal one either... the one for unix stuffs
[09/26 13:29] <02charlie> i change everything at the same time
[09/26 13:29] <06Amit_ZOS> 'Password Expiration for account nenminax in the UNIX domain olsprod 09/05/2017'
[09/26 13:29] <triveni> mine got expired. i have to raise a webstar
[09/26 13:30] <triveni> :D
[09/26 13:30] <02charlie> and the password police were starting to nag me in the corner of the desktop
[09/26 13:30] <02charlie> hadnt gotten to the email point yet
[09/26 13:31] <dsk_hbe> this is blowing my mind... you all know I delete nothing but sure can't find those emails in here for anything!
[09/26 13:32] <JimE_zOS> sorry, Debbie, I'm no help
[09/26 13:32] <triveni> u must hv forgotten something
[09/26 13:32] <JimE_zOS> once I change my password, I delete those. 
[09/26 13:32] <dsk_hbe> well, actually I do for those too... but I haven't emptied my delete folder in, um, a while :-)
[09/26 13:32] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 13:33] <02charlie> yeah, i delete them by a rule :)
[09/26 13:33] <02charlie> i guess it had gotten to the email point: Password Expiration for account lesterct in the UNIX domain olsprod 09/25/2017
[09/26 13:34] <dsk_hbe> too late ;-)
[09/26 13:34] <dsk_hbe> Amit beat you... youngster that he is ;-)
[09/26 13:34] <02charlie> it's in my deleted mail (put there by my rule :)
[09/26 13:34] <02charlie> i didnt think i had started getting the emails....the rule is working well! :D
[09/26 13:36] <06Amit_ZOS> lol.. what was the subject line then?
[09/26 13:36] <06Amit_ZOS> did you find it debbie?
[09/26 13:37] <dsk_hbe> nope... they're gone from this earth... no clue why... I hate when thigns mess with my emails!
[09/26 13:37] <06Amit_ZOS> hmm
[09/26 13:37] <dsk_hbe> probably some generic rule somewhere that I didn't set up... never ever have I set up a rule... I like to have too much control of my email ;-)
[09/26 13:38] <dsk_hbe> anywho... I asked Cassidy abotu my login to dc2 box thing and he kenw of previous examples fo people encountering this... yay
[09/26 13:38] <02charlie> My rule is: from use-infra@lexisnexis.com and with "Password expiration" in the subject, move it to deleted and stop
[09/26 13:39] <dsk_hbe> I hope that doesn't bite you some day and cause you do have to get a reset ;-)
[09/26 13:40] <02charlie> since i change everything at the same time, i dont think that will happen
[09/26 13:40] <02charlie> exchange, zos, unix, lexis, ldc, everything
[09/26 13:40] <02charlie> and they all give their own version of complaining
[09/26 13:42] <02charlie> beat that dead horse! beat that dead horse! (innovating)
[09/26 13:43] <dsk_hbe> Like my daughter who drug her feet about renewing her expired driver's license and now is worried if she will receive the renewed license in the mail in time for her plane trip next week, I will try to avoid saying I told you so and just pass along sympathy and support ;-)
[09/26 13:44] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 13:44] <dsk_hbe> (its' so hard sometimes ;-)
[09/26 13:44] <02charlie> thats ok, you can say i told you so if it happens :)
[09/26 13:44] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/26 13:45] <06Amit_ZOS> drug her feet--- new phrase!
[09/26 13:45] <02charlie> folks, you have 15 minutes left to finishing discussing the wording on the proposal
[09/26 13:45] <dsk_hbe> I'm old... I am sure you will hear many an old saying if you listen closely ;-)
[09/26 13:47] <02charlie> sheesh
[09/26 13:47] <02charlie> done!
[09/26 13:47] <dsk_hbe> man, that was a long one... who was the chatty person tehre?
[09/26 13:48] <02charlie> ian sombdoy
[09/26 13:48] <02charlie> somebody
[09/26 13:48] <02charlie> sheesh
[09/26 13:49] <02charlie> what do we quantify our time innovating as?
[09/26 13:49] <dsk_hbe> good question. let me know when you get the answer ;-)
[09/26 13:49] <06Amit_ZOS> lunch
[09/26 13:49] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 13:50] <triveni> i dont like "i told you so".. so try skipping on it.. she must b already feeling bad.
[09/26 13:51] <02charlie> your daughter should come to ky. they give you your license on the spot
[09/26 13:51] <triveni> am trying to find a pcp.
[09/26 13:51] <triveni> if anyone can help
[09/26 13:52] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I held it back and just offered her info on TSA and DPS guidelines I found online.  I htink she will be fine with the printed temporary as long as she also has her expired license with her, but said be sure to get there early in case TSA decides to teach you a lesson
[09/26 13:52] <triveni> no one is taking new patients
[09/26 13:52] <triveni> and i have tried contacting a lot of them.
[09/26 13:52] <dsk_hbe> I think they do in Ohio too, don't they?  I think this si the first state I have lived in that doesn't
[09/26 13:52] <triveni> if u can suggest any primary care physician.
[09/26 13:52] <triveni> lemme know
[09/26 13:53] <dsk_hbe> let me ask a couple friends that live near work, Triveni.  I'll see if I can get you a recommendation
[09/26 13:53] <triveni> that ll be great
[09/26 13:53] <triveni> thx
[09/26 14:01] <dsk_hbe> no replies yet... sicne you know her, you might ask Anita.  I'm not sure how close she lives to work though.
[09/26 14:02] <triveni> am also trying to find an orthopedician and a neurosurgeon. if u get any luck..lemme know.
[09/26 14:02] <triveni> i ll try asking her.
[09/26 14:03] <triveni> lemme see if charlie or Jim can get me anything.
[09/26 14:03] <dsk_hbe> boy I'd not know where to begin on the last one.  Gail might have a good ortho suggestion.  I'll contact her.  She lives in Beavercreek though... do you prefer tryign to stay close to Springboro or Miamisburg?
[09/26 14:03] <02charlie> i dont, i lve down in ky
[09/26 14:04] <dsk_hbe> Charlie lives in Kentucky and Jim in Waynesvill so they may not have close by options but doesn't hurt to ask
[09/26 14:04] <triveni> if i can find close by its good. beavercreek will work too.
[09/26 14:09] <dsk_hbe> ok, sent Gail a note.  will let you know when I hear back.
[09/26 14:11] <triveni> thx debbie.
[09/26 14:14] <dsk_hbe> woohoo... the guy whose Monday PQ ends up costing us 2M doc browses says we can get rid of his alerts.
[09/26 14:14] <02charlie> excellent! woohoo!
[09/26 14:14] <06Amit_ZOS> Awesome!
[09/26 14:17] <JimE_zOS> is anybody else getting security alerts from Outlook? 
[09/26 14:17] <triveni> cool!
[09/26 14:17] <triveni> sometimes
[09/26 14:17] <triveni> i accept it
[09/26 14:18] <triveni> it started happening recently
[09/26 14:18] <dsk_hbe> boy I don't think so?
[09/26 14:18] <JimE_zOS> I am....agree that it started recently. 
[09/26 14:19] <JimE_zOS> and I NEVER accept them unless told my a company email to do so. 
[09/26 14:20] <triveni> honestly i dont remember.. what i did with all of it..there were a few.. sometimes i ignored it. and at times i accepted. 
[09/26 14:22] <dsk_hbe> I can't think what kind of alerts you mean?
[09/26 14:22] <JimE_zOS> I've got a screen grab.  I'll share. 
[09/26 14:24] <dsk_hbe> thanks... nothign I have seen yet but I'll know to be cautious!
[09/26 14:24] <02charlie> no, not that i recall
[09/26 14:24] <06Amit_ZOS> no i dont get those
[09/26 14:24] <triveni> yeah i get those
[09/26 14:24] <02charlie> in relation to reading email?
[09/26 14:29] <02charlie> let me re-try my access to dc2 now, it worked for me earlier today
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> Password:
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> Access denied
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> Password:
[09/26 14:30] <02charlie> nice
[09/26 14:31] <dsk_hbe> fancy that
[09/26 14:31] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I haven't been able to get to any dc2 box all afternoon
[09/26 14:31] <dsk_hbe> yesterday it was much more sporatic
[09/26 14:31] <02charlie> if this doesnt pop up: Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
[09/26 14:31] <02charlie> then it works
[09/26 14:32] <02charlie> i got onto 2825, no problem
[09/26 14:32] <dsk_hbe> bizarre isn't it
[09/26 14:32] <dsk_hbe> no such luck here
[09/26 14:33] <dsk_hbe> and no such pop-up so I don't knwo if that is a true indicator
[09/26 14:33] <JimE_zOS> pay no attention to the firewall behind the curtain! 
[09/26 14:34] <02charlie> that's thursday
[09/26 14:34] <dsk_hbe> that email I forwarded suggests it's not firewall (this time ;-)  but that's why I asked JimC to start with... glad he'd heard of it from others!
[09/26 14:34] <02charlie> hmm
[09/26 14:34] <02charlie> i notice on 2825 i got this too: Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
[09/26 14:35] <02charlie> but the difference betwwen it and 2826 is there's an extra linefeed for the ones that fail
[09/26 14:35] <dsk_hbe> sometimes I do, sometimes I don't... dogs and cats... no, what was it?
[09/26 14:35] <JimE_zOS> see that would suggest to clueless me that they had blocked a port needed by ssh 
[09/26 14:35] <dsk_hbe> you can spend all day trying to make sense of it Charlie, trust me ;-)
[09/26 14:35] <02charlie> chaos, dogs and cats living together 
[09/26 14:36] <dsk_hbe> but I can get in sometimes, Jim... it all makes no sense to me
[09/26 14:36] <02charlie> this works:
[09/26 14:36] <02charlie> ###################################################################
[09/26 14:36] <02charlie> Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
[09/26 14:36] <02charlie> i'm betting this will fail:

[09/26 14:36] <dsk_hbe> I'm going to stop listenign to Charlie's info now... it's like groundhog day for me ;-)
[09/26 14:37] <dsk_hbe> gonna step away for a bit!  have a good evening all!
[09/26 14:37] <02charlie> the "." is just so it wouldnt drop the line
[09/26 14:37] * dsk_hbe is now known as dsk_away
[09/26 14:37] <JimE_zOS> so you are telling me that I could check now, be fine, and need the access later and not be? 
[09/26 14:37] <02charlie> G&Q night debbie
[09/26 14:37] <dsk_away> yep Jim
[09/26 14:37] <JimE_zOS> G & Q night, Debbie. 
[09/26 14:37] <06Amit_ZOS> Gnight Debbie! :)
[09/26 14:37] <JimE_zOS> not watching EOD/SOD tonight. 
[09/26 14:37] <JimE_zOS> but happy to take a page
[09/26 14:38] <dsk_away> I will go to bed knowing it was crafted by the king ;-)
[09/26 14:38] <JimE_zOS> yeah, Charles III here :-)
[09/26 14:38] <dsk_away> ;-)
[09/26 14:38] <dsk_away> bye!!
[09/26 14:38] <02charlie> lol
[09/26 14:38] <JimE_zOS> that, BTW, was in no way a reflection on Charlie.  Just going for the historical reference. 
[09/26 14:39] <02charlie> i understood that :) at least it wasnt Charles I (he lost hs head)
[09/26 14:39] <JimE_zOS> when people say "bridge too far", I think they get to use historical references freely 
[09/26 14:40] <02charlie> rotflmao
[09/26 14:40] <02charlie> perfectly permissible :D
[09/26 14:40] <JimE_zOS> thank you.

[09/27 10:34] <02charlie> i'm guessing we have no DW MVS diaries we save?
[09/27 10:34] <02charlie> even yesterday's
[09/27 10:34] <dsk_hbe> oh sure we do... sec
[09/27 10:35] <02charlie> and btw, folks, i'm happy to close out push tickets if you all want
[09/27 10:35] <dsk_hbe> they're named like this... I think we blame Dave for that naming if I recall ;-) PE00.DW1.PROD.DRY.D170926
[09/27 10:36] <02charlie> thx
[09/27 10:37] <02charlie> but none on disk
[09/27 10:37] <02charlie> just cart
[09/27 10:37] <dsk_hbe> no, I just attached the above dsn and it came up fine 
[09/27 10:38] <dsk_hbe> looks like even the older ones are cart
[09/27 10:38] <dsk_hbe> now diskstats... those may be cart cause they are so freaking big
[09/27 10:38] <02charlie> oh, diskstat are cart
[09/27 10:38] <02charlie> jinx
[09/27 10:38] <dsk_hbe> I seem to remember when Jim did that after oen of their especially ridiculous day of monitor usage
[09/27 10:39] <dsk_hbe> you can jinx all you want but when I say it first I still win ;-) ;-)
[09/27 10:39] <02charlie> rotflmao

[09/27 10:49] <dsk_hbe> such the pig ;-)
[09/27 10:49] <06Amit_ZOS> his highest cpu since you started recording!
[09/27 10:49] <02charlie> is that the internal user?
[09/27 10:50] <02charlie> btw, i can see that our michigan inmate was a pig again yesterday
[09/27 10:50] <dsk_hbe> I cannot wait for Vickie's changes in the 10/8 release... this user is the one that runs a ton of w/s and w/p serches... she's going to satart processing them with the negative news process... sure hope that calms him down
[09/27 10:50] <02charlie> lots of FDRETC abends for him
[09/27 10:50] <06Amit_ZOS> you know, when you had told me regarding your weekofxx files that you do everyday, i started making them too with all top 5 guys from dsk20 50 and 60
[09/27 10:50] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I saw him too Charlie... he showed up in the top docs for cpu :-(
[09/27 10:51] <06Amit_ZOS> but i lacked discipline to carry it more than a month..lol
[09/27 10:51] <dsk_hbe> missed the above... no, zgmbzz is Commerzbank
[09/27 10:51] <02charlie> ah
[09/27 10:52] <dsk_hbe> honestly, Amit, I'm not sure if this one will help but after this ID showed up out of the blue, I decided we needed to track it at least for now.
[09/27 10:52] <dsk_hbe> NOrmally I just keep notes in my notepads and dig if needed... some fo the top users don't deserve to be bothered... liek the ID that always tops the SOR counts... his searches aren't that bad even with the high counts
[09/27 10:55] <06Amit_ZOS> i see
[09/27 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> and also, i noticed you record all fg id's untill your barometer 8FHH7F?
[09/27 10:56] <06Amit_ZOS> btw, i have updated and uploaded the excel file.. 
[09/27 10:56] <dsk_hbe> yeah, I kinda decided to do that... we'll see if he holds up.  If the list is too long, I don't think we shodul take it out that far
[09/27 10:56] <dsk_hbe> thank you Amit!
[09/27 10:57] <06Amit_ZOS> Sure thing! :)
[09/27 10:57] <dsk_hbe> I had shared with Wayne and Steve that we were keeping this doc and asked if they'd like access to it.  So far neither have said anything, though Wayne is PTO this week.  BUt if they do and I grant them access to it in sharepoint, I'll let you know.
[09/27 10:58] <06Amit_ZOS> sure

[09/27 11:22] <JimE_zOS> by way of sharing, IPL of SYSG this coming weekend. 
[09/27 11:22] <JimE_zOS> and, of course, I don't (yet) handle HCP movement. 
[09/27 11:22] <JimE_zOS> I might end up being Debbie's IPL buddy 
[09/27 11:23] <02charlie> when do they ipl it?
[09/27 11:23] <JimE_zOS> 2am, give or take. 
[09/27 11:23] <dsk_hbe> they let stuff come up cleanly and then take it away, rigt?
[09/27 11:23] <02charlie> do they always do them then? i thought i'd seen some other times
[09/27 11:24] <JimE_zOS> yes, Debbie, they could. 
[09/27 11:24] <JimE_zOS> trying to find something better. 
[09/27 11:24] <JimE_zOS> and (Charlie) internal cluster systems are alwasy at SOD 
[09/27 11:24] <JimE_zOS> SR systems in the afternoons, usually 
[09/27 11:24] <02charlie> ah, that's what i'm remembering
[09/27 11:24] <dsk_hbe> yeah, they have 02:45 on the change request
[09/27 11:25] <JimE_zOS> because they still think of this in the Bridge 1.0 way 
[09/27 11:26] <dsk_hbe> I'm just wondering though, now that I remembered their timing, why that won't work still?
[09/27 11:26] <02charlie> so once sysg comes back up, what application would we add to get the copies up again?
[09/27 11:26] <dsk_hbe> I'm sure Jim has a plan... I'll shut up now :-)
[09/27 11:27] <JimE_zOS> it probably would, Debbie. 
[09/27 11:27] <JimE_zOS> still want something better. 
[09/27 11:27] <JimE_zOS> and (Charlie) after SOD, OPS is on their own. 
[09/27 11:27] <JimE_zOS> so they would start whatever copies they want/need. 
[09/27 11:27] <JimE_zOS> I have considered adding an application to the current plan to put things back they way they should be 
[09/27 11:28] <JimE_zOS> and I may still do that, but it requires additional development because I have to know what enqueue to work toward. 
[09/27 11:28] <JimE_zOS> I could guess, of course, but that isn't how my code works. 
[09/27 11:29] <JimE_zOS> and trusting OPS is out of the question. 
[09/27 11:29] <02charlie> well, wouldnt just adding a copy of SE00OLSCFG@0200Y to run immediately do it?
[09/27 11:29] <JimE_zOS> if you want the copies in bridge mode, sure. 
[09/27 11:30] <JimE_zOS> but at 14:00, I assure you you don't 
[09/27 11:30] <JimE_zOS> in fact, that would cause an outage. 
[09/27 11:30] <02charlie> doesnt that put them back to prod mode?
[09/27 11:30] <JimE_zOS> because when bridge SOD runs, all of hte copies will be running against those datasets. 
[09/27 11:31] <02charlie> and bridge SOD runs at 1500, right?
[09/27 11:31] <JimE_zOS> it does, yes. 
[09/27 11:32] <JimE_zOS> but the point is that I have to trust OPS to pick the right application. 
[09/27 11:32] <02charlie> ah, yes
[09/27 11:32] <JimE_zOS> and if they pick the wrong one, an outage will be cause and (you know this is true) it'll be my fault. 
[09/27 11:32] <02charlie> i was thinking of us controlling it
[09/27 11:33] <JimE_zOS> oh, yeah, no 
[09/27 11:33] <dsk_hbe> ahem... no plans here to be up unless paged
[09/27 11:33] <JimE_zOS> I'm not watching IPLs 
[09/27 11:43] <02charlie> im trying to understand the flow, and also put it into context for bcp
[09/27 11:44] <JimE_zOS> sure....of course. 
[09/27 11:44] <JimE_zOS> we'll get there
[09/27 11:44] <JimE_zOS> and we'll get there before BCP. 
[09/27 11:44] <02charlie> ok :D

[09/27 11:45] <JimE_zOS> based on the information Kerri gave me this morning on the sidewalk, it might very well work differently when we go to use it for BCP. 
[09/27 11:46] * triveni has joined #theRock
[09/27 11:46] <JimE_zOS> I'm sure it will work differently for the release. 
[09/27 11:48] <JimE_zOS> I need a slug (way more than a splash) of coffee.  BRB 
[09/27 11:56] <JimE_zOS> back

[09/27 11:57] * triveni has joined #theRock
[09/27 11:57] <triveni> my internet problems. ignore me please.
[09/27 12:17] <dsk_hbe> this innovating stuff takes too long
[09/27 12:19] <JimE_zOS> not if you just code what you want and put it in production.  Done. 
[09/27 12:19] <02charlie> lol
[09/27 12:19] <JimE_zOS> well, except for the immediate enhancements :-)
[09/27 12:19] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/27 12:24] <dsk_hbe> done finally... 9 minutes past the meetign schedule... darn it ;-)
[09/27 12:33] <02charlie> if we ran another copy of the 0200Y application when the system was in the prod configuration, i thought it would not end up doing anything, because it would find all the copies in the correct configuration. Am i correct?
[09/27 12:37] <06Amit_ZOS> getting some lunch

[09/27 12:37] * Amit_ZOS is now known as Amit_away
[09/27 12:39] <triveni> brb
[09/27 12:58] <JimE_zOS> sorry, wasn't watching, Charlie.  Yes, true. 
[09/27 12:59] <02charlie> so if one copy was down (eg IPL) and everything else was in prod mode, adding another copy of 200Y would bring up the missing copy and leave all the others alone?
[09/27 12:59] <JimE_zOS> true....but what if OPS add that after the bridge app has run. 
[09/27 12:59] <JimE_zOS> (that was a question) 
[09/27 13:00] <02charlie> that would shift all the copies to prod mode from bridge, which would be bad :)
[09/27 13:00] <JimE_zOS> yep. 
[09/27 13:00] <JimE_zOS> OPS can't be trusted. 
[09/27 13:00] <02charlie> and bring up the missing copy in prod mode
[09/27 13:00] <JimE_zOS> thinking that they can start copies outside of OPC (DW copies) is all the proof I need. 
[09/27 13:00] <02charlie> yeah, i understand that.
[09/27 13:01] <JimE_zOS> not if they added a bridge app....it'll make the enviornment bridge...including copy starts/stops. 
[09/27 13:02] <02charlie> right, but not the 0200*s
[09/27 13:02] <02charlie> those all drive to prod, right?
[09/27 13:02] <JimE_zOS> the bridge apps aren't the 0200* 
[09/27 13:02] <02charlie> right
[09/27 13:02] <JimE_zOS> oh, yes, true. 
[09/27 13:02] <02charlie> but my questions have related to the 0200* ones
[09/27 13:03] <JimE_zOS> if you are asking if I trust somebody in SS to add the right app to the plan at teh right time (after an IPL), sure. 
[09/27 13:03] <JimE_zOS> the only way I'll let OPS do that is with failsafes in places. 
[09/27 13:03] <JimE_zOS> place, even 
[09/27 13:04] <JimE_zOS> and those aren't there yet. 
[09/27 13:04] <02charlie> i'm just trying to wrap my mind around everything you've done, so that i understand *precisely* what they do and dont do
[09/27 13:04] <JimE_zOS> the number of things that had to be changed to make this new thing work is almost beyond description. 
[09/27 13:04] <02charlie> cuz the last thing i'd want to do is cause an outage because i didnt understand
[09/27 13:04] <JimE_zOS> we'll get there. 
[09/27 13:05] <02charlie> oh, i'm just getting a whiff of the complexity just watching and reading :)
[09/27 13:05] <JimE_zOS> getting the infrastructure in place took hours, thought, coe and most of my super powers. 
[09/27 13:05] <02charlie> lol
[09/27 13:05] <JimE_zOS> heck, I even had to define a TSO segment for U#OLMR1 
[09/27 13:05] <02charlie> i hope you didnt use up all your superpowers :)
[09/27 13:06] <JimE_zOS> so many of the safeguards aren't in place yet. 
[09/27 13:06] <02charlie> sheesh, that's pretty extreme
[09/27 13:06] <JimE_zOS> I changed hundreds and hundreds of OPC dependencies. 
[09/27 13:06] <02charlie> ah, was that to get the rexx TSO address space to work for it?
[09/27 13:06] <JimE_zOS> procs, JCL, code, new code, new JCL, new variable tables, etc. 
[09/27 13:07] <JimE_zOS> so while I get that you have a need to know (and I agree, you do), I'm just not ready to do that yet. 
[09/27 13:07] <02charlie> sure
[09/27 13:07] <JimE_zOS> for one, things are going to continue to change as I deal with the IPL, release and BCP needs. 
[09/27 13:08] <JimE_zOS> second, I've got a raft (even bigger than a slug) of security work to do. 
[09/27 13:08] <02charlie> ah yeah, all of which are coming like the proverbial light in the tunnel :)
[09/27 13:08] <JimE_zOS> this framework offers all sorts of potential...that's why I built it. 
[09/27 13:09] <JimE_zOS> but I don't want to exploit it just yet until I get the basics down. (IPL, release and BCP) 
[09/27 13:10] <JimE_zOS> oh, and one even more basic, getting that PUSH mode auto-ticket stopped
[09/27 13:11] <JimE_zOS> feelers out to Scott to discuss. 
[09/27 13:11] <02charlie> i can close those tickets if you want
[09/27 13:11] <JimE_zOS> I made the mess, so happy to clean it up. 
[09/27 13:11] <JimE_zOS> but I want those in case I have to justify something to Scott. 
[09/27 13:12] <JimE_zOS> mostly I don't want an oncaller to eat a 01:45 page for no good reason 
[09/27 13:12] <02charlie> larry didnt page last night's, he just assigned it to us
[09/27 13:13] <JimE_zOS> and that is certainly better than a page. 
[09/27 13:13] <JimE_zOS> but with Larry, you never know what you'll get. 
[09/27 13:13] <JimE_zOS> by the time he gets back on Monday (or whatever day) he may forget and page. 
[09/27 13:13] <JimE_zOS> that would be bad. 
[09/27 13:14] <JimE_zOS> trying to get out in front of that issue before it turns into a meaningless page. 
[09/27 13:15] <JimE_zOS> FWIW, the shift at this end of hte week has also seen the PUSH auto-tickets. 
[09/27 13:16] <JimE_zOS> but I'' stop in the DC after shirt change to remind them. 
[09/27 13:16] <JimE_zOS> (my shirt must be dirty) 
[09/27 13:16] <dsk_hbe> ;-)
[09/27 13:16] <JimE_zOS> how about SHIFT change

[09/27 14:01] <02charlie> eh?
[09/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> I said that I thought all OPC IDs could see everything. 
[09/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> and now I understand that not to be true: 
[09/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> U#OLMR1   READ   <- added
[09/27 14:01] <JimE_zOS> Doug had to add our ID to an OPC owner code. 
[09/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> so, OPC don't see everything. 
[09/27 14:02] <02charlie> ah, so we (ie, U#OLMR1) could see the ipl prep application 
[09/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> so I'm here to retract yesterday's comment.  
[09/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> yep, that is true. 
[09/27 14:02] <02charlie> ok, then that makes sense with what i seem to recall
[09/27 14:02] <JimE_zOS> sorry to confuse

[09/27 16:24] <JimE_zOS> for the record, the Caddy belongs to George. 
[09/27 16:25] <02charlie> i figured it was certainly not his vehicle :D

[09/27 16:25] <JimE_zOS> kinda like a spa wrap with seaweed. 
[09/27 16:25] <02charlie> rotflmao, stop it, stop it! :D
[09/27 16:26] <JimE_zOS> here....to help you stop laughing.  BCP, PDP, Manila
[09/27 16:26] <JimE_zOS> sobering, yes? 
[09/27 16:27] <triveni> i dont think i ll ever b wise enough to get these jokes
[09/27 16:27] <JimE_zOS> Doug was being a great big clown one fall RE: football. 
[09/27 16:28] <JimE_zOS> so I brought pallet wrap (think Saran Wrap, but stronger) and I wrapped his truck in it. 
[09/27 16:28] <02charlie> lol
[09/27 16:28] <JimE_zOS> I put a Brown's flag under the pallet wrap so was visable. 
[09/27 16:29] <02charlie> and yes, those are sobering, thanks! :D
[09/27 16:30] <02charlie> but in the context, causing more laughter :)
[09/27 16:31] <triveni> i ll let u guys play
[09/27 16:31] <triveni> continue
[09/27 16:31] <triveni> heeheh
[09/27 16:31] <JimE_zOS> pictures on the way 
[09/27 16:31] <06Amit_ZOS> lol
[09/27 16:31] <02charlie> that was last year during football season, iirc
[09/27 16:31] <JimE_zOS> or the year before.  I forget. 
[09/27 16:32] <triveni> u did that
[09/27 16:32] <triveni> hahaha
[09/27 16:32] <triveni> and that too just for fun
[09/27 16:32] <02charlie> see the browns flag on the passenger's side
[09/27 16:33] <02charlie> iirc, it was the week before the steelers were playing the browns
[09/27 16:34] <JimE_zOS> I never did get that Brown's flag back. 
[09/27 16:34] <triveni> ahhaah
